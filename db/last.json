        "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/mremap: fix move_normal_pmd/retract_page_tables race\n\nIn mremap(), move_page_tables() looks at the type of the PMD entry and the\nspecified address range to figure out by which method the next chunk of\npage table entries should be moved.\n\nAt that point, the mmap_lock is held in write mode, but no rmap locks are\nheld yet.  For PMD entries that point to page tables and are fully covered\nby the source address range, move_pgt_entry(NORMAL_PMD, ...) is called,\nwhich first takes rmap locks, then does move_normal_pmd(). \nmove_normal_pmd() takes the necessary page table locks at source and\ndestination, then moves an entire page table from the source to the\ndestination.\n\nThe problem is: The rmap locks, which protect against concurrent page\ntable removal by retract_page_tables() in the THP code, are only taken\nafter the PMD entry has been read and it has been decided how to move it. \nSo we can race as follows (with two processes that have mappings of the\nsame tmpfs file that is stored on a tmpfs mount with huge=advise); note\nthat process A accesses page tables through the MM while process B does it\nthrough the file rmap:\n\nprocess A                      process B\n=========                      =========\nmremap\n  mremap_to\n    move_vma\n      move_page_tables\n        get_old_pmd\n        alloc_new_pmd\n                      *** PREEMPT ***\n                               madvise(MADV_COLLAPSE)\n                                 do_madvise\n                                   madvise_walk_vmas\n                                     madvise_vma_behavior\n                                       madvise_collapse\n                                         hpage_collapse_scan_file\n                                           collapse_file\n                                             retract_page_tables\n                                               i_mmap_lock_read(mapping)\n                                               pmdp_collapse_flush\n                                               i_mmap_unlock_read(mapping)\n        move_pgt_entry(NORMAL_PMD, ...)\n          take_rmap_locks\n          move_normal_pmd\n          drop_rmap_locks\n\nWhen this happens, move_normal_pmd() can end up creating bogus PMD entries\nin the line `pmd_populate(mm, new_pmd, pmd_pgtable(pmd))`.  The effect\ndepends on arch-specific and machine-specific details; on x86, you can end\nup with physical page 0 mapped as a page table, which is likely\nexploitable for user->kernel privilege escalation.\n\nFix the race by letting process B recheck that the PMD still points to a\npage table after the rmap locks have been taken.  Otherwise, we bail and\nlet the caller fall back to the PTE-level copying path, which will then\nbail immediately at the pmd_none() check.\n\nBug reachability: Reaching this bug requires that you can create\nshmem/file THP mappings - anonymous THP uses different code that doesn't\nzap stuff under rmap locks.  File THP is gated on an experimental config\nflag (CONFIG_READ_ONLY_THP_FOR_FS), so on normal distro kernels you need\nshmem THP to hit this bug.  As far as I know, getting shmem THP normally\nrequires that you can mount your own tmpfs with the right mount flags,\nwhich would require creating your own user+mount namespace; though I don't\nknow if some distros maybe enable shmem THP by default or something like\nthat.\n\nBug impact: This issue can likely be used for user->kernel privilege\nescalation when it is reachable."

One of the most critical parameters that could be abused by a malicious user is the `leftupdown`key. This key takes an executable command as a value and is used to specify what executes as a callback in NetworkManager-libreswan to retrieve configuration settings back to NetworkManager. As NetworkManager uses Polkit to allow an unprivileged user to control the system's network configuration, a malicious actor could achieve local privilege escalation and potential code execution as root in the targeted machine."

        "summary": "Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI. Prior to Sep 27, 2024, if a user generated a terminal command via Cursor's Terminal Cmd-K/Ctrl-K feature and if the user explicitly imported a malicious web page into the Terminal Cmd-K prompt, an attacker with control over the referenced web page could have a significant chance of influencing a language model to output arbitrary commands for execution in the user's terminal. This scenario would require the user explicitly opt-in to including the contents of a compromised webpage, and it would require that the attacker display prompt injection text in the the contents of the compromised webpage.\n\nA server-side patch to not stream back newlines or control characters was released on September 27, 2024, within two hours of the issue being reported. Additionally, Cursor 0.42 includes client-side mitigations to prevent any newline or control character from being streamed into the terminal directly. It also contains a new setting, `\"cursor.terminal.usePreviewBox\"`, which, if set to true, streams the response into a preview box whose contents then have to be manually accepted before being inserted into the terminal. This setting is useful if you're working in a shell environment where commands can be executed without pressing enter or any control character. The patch has been applied server-side, so no additional action is needed, even on older versions of Cursor. Separately, Cursor's maintainers also recommend, as best practice, to only include trusted pieces of context in prompts."
