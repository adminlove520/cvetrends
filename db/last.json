All later versions of Windows 10 are not impacted by this vulnerability.\nThis servicing stack vulnerability is addressed by installing the September 2024 Servicing stack update (SSU KB5043936) AND the September 2024 Windows security update (KB5043083), in that order.\nNote: Windows 10, version 1507 reached the end of support (EOS) on May 9, 2017 for devices running the Pro, Home, Enterprise, Education, and Enterprise IoT editions. Only Windows 10 Enterprise 2015 LTSB and Windows 10 IoT Enterprise 2015 LTSB editions are still under support."
