An authenticated user, having access to both the medical device WiFi network (such as a biomedical engineering staff member) and the specific B.Braun Battery Pack SP with WiFi web server credentials, could get administrative (root) access on the infusion pump communication module. This could be used as a vector to start further attacks"

An attacker who submits a crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger undefined behavior in the form of math division by zero. This would most likely lead to an impact to application availability, but could potentially cause other problems related to undefined behavior. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.8-68."

Red Hat Product Security marked this as Low severity because although it could potentially lead to an impact to application availability, no specific impact was shown in this case. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 6.9.10-69."
