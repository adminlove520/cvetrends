On architectures where\nunsigned long is 64 bytes, the argument will be implicitly truncated.\n\nUse div64_u64() instead of div_u64() so that the value used in the \"is\nthis a safe division\" check is the same as the divisor.\n\nAlso, remove redundant cast of the numerator to u64, as that should happen\nimplicitly.\n\nThis would be difficult to exploit in memcg domain, given the ratio-based\narithmetic domain_drity_limits() uses, but is much easier in global\nwriteback domain with a BDI_CAP_STRICTLIMIT-backing device, using e.g. \nvm.dirty_bytes=(1<<32)*PAGE_SIZE so that dtc->thresh == (1<<32)"

This allows attackers to execute arbitrary programs by embedding a reference to a local executable file such as file:///C:/WINDOWS/system32/cmd.exe and file:///C:/WINDOWS/system32/calc.exe.

When used to parse sufficiently long strings of characters without a space, `parse_query_string` would take an unexpectedly large amount of time to process, resulting in a denial of service. In an initial Wagtail installation, the vulnerability can be exploited by any Wagtail admin user. It cannot be exploited by end users. If your Wagtail site has a custom search implementation which uses `parse_query_string`, it may be exploitable by other users (e.g. unauthenticated users).
