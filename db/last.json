        "summary": "An SQL Injection vulnerability in Apache Superset exists due to improper neutralization of special elements used in SQL commands. Specifically, certain engine-specific functions are not checked, which allows attackers to bypass Apache Superset's SQL authorization. To mitigate this, a new configuration key named DISALLOWED_SQL_FUNCTIONS has been introduced. This key disallows the use of the following PostgreSQL functions: version, query_to_xml, inet_server_addr, and inet_client_addr. Additional functions can be added to this list for increased protection.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Superset: before 4.0.2.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 4.0.2, which fixes the issue.\n\n"

This behavior appears to\nbe consistent with Solaris NFS servers.\n\nNote that NFSv3 and NFSv4 use u64 offset values on the wire.

Getting that -EIO means that we return\nimmediately as we can not iterate over the entire tree.\n\nIn that case we never update the reserved space for an extent buffer in\nthe respective block group and space_info object.\n\nWhen this happens we get the following traces when unmounting the fs:\n\n[174957.284509] BTRFS: error (device dm-0) in cleanup_transaction:1913: errno=-5 IO failure\n[174957.286497] BTRFS: error (device dm-0) in free_log_tree:3420: errno=-5 IO failure\n[174957.399379] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n[174957.402497] WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 3206883 at fs/btrfs/block-group.c:127 btrfs_put_block_group+0x77/0xb0 [btrfs]\n[174957.407523] Modules linked in: btrfs overlay dm_zero (...)\n[174957.424917] CPU: 2 PID: 3206883 Comm: umount Tainted: G        W         5.16.0-rc5-btrfs-next-109 #1\n[174957.426689] Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS rel-1.14.0-0-g155821a1990b-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014\n[174957.428716] RIP: 0010:btrfs_put_block_group+0x77/0xb0 [btrfs]\n[174957.429717] Code: 21 48 8b bd (...)\n[174957.432867] RSP: 0018:ffffb70d41cffdd0 EFLAGS: 00010206\n[174957.433632] RAX: 0000000000000001 RBX: ffff8b09c3848000 RCX: ffff8b0758edd1c8\n[174957.434689] RDX: 0000000000000001 RSI: ffffffffc0b467e7 RDI: ffff8b0758edd000\n[174957.436068] RBP: ffff8b0758edd000 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: 0000000000000000\n[174957.437114] R10: 0000000000000246 R11: 0000000000000000 R12: ffff8b09c3848148\n[174957.438140] R13: ffff8b09c3848198 R14: ffff8b0758edd188 R15: dead000000000100\n[174957.439317] FS:  00007f328fb82800(0000) GS:ffff8b0a2d200000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\n[174957.440402] CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\n[174957.441164] CR2: 00007fff13563e98 CR3: 0000000404f4e005 CR4: 0000000000370ee0\n[174957.442117] DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000\n[174957.443076] DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400\n[174957.443948] Call Trace:\n[174957.444264]  <TASK>\n[174957.444538]  btrfs_free_block_groups+0x255/0x3c0 [btrfs]\n[174957.445238]  close_ctree+0x301/0x357 [btrfs]\n[174957.445803]  ? call_rcu+0x16c/0x290\n[174957.446250]  generic_shutdown_super+0x74/0x120\n[174957.446832]  kill_anon_super+0x14/0x30\n[174957.447305]  btrfs_kill_super+0x12/0x20 [btrfs]\n[174957.447890]  deactivate_locked_super+0x31/0xa0\n[174957.448440]  cleanup_mnt+0x147/0x1c0\n[174957.448888]  task_work_run+0x5c/0xa0\n[174957.449336]  exit_to_user_mode_prepare+0x1e5/0x1f0\n[174957.449934]  syscall_exit_to_user_mode+0x16/0x40\n[174957.450512]  do_syscall_64+0x48/0xc0\n[174957.450980]  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae\n[174957.451605] RIP: 0033:0x7f328fdc4a97\n[174957.452059] Code: 03 0c 00 f7 (...)\n[174957.454320] RSP: 002b:00007fff13564ec8 EFLAGS: 00000246 ORIG_RAX: 00000000000000a6\n[174957.455262] RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: 00007f328feea264 RCX: 00007f328fdc4a97\n[174957.456131] RDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: 00000000000000\n---truncated---"

        "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nswiotlb: fix info leak with DMA_FROM_DEVICE\n\nThe problem I'm addressing was discovered by the LTP test covering\ncve-2018-1000204.\n\nA short description of what happens follows:\n1) The test case issues a command code 00 (TEST UNIT READY) via the SG_IO\n   interface with: dxfer_len == 524288, dxdfer_dir == SG_DXFER_FROM_DEV\n   and a corresponding dxferp. The peculiar thing about this is that TUR\n   is not reading from the device.\n2) In sg_start_req() the invocation of blk_rq_map_user() effectively\n   bounces the user-space buffer. As if the device was to transfer into\n   it. Since commit a45b599ad808 (\"scsi: sg: allocate with __GFP_ZERO in\n   sg_build_indirect()\") we make sure this first bounce buffer is\n   allocated with GFP_ZERO.\n3) For the rest of the story we keep ignoring that we have a TUR, so the\n   device won't touch the buffer we prepare as if the we had a\n   DMA_FROM_DEVICE type of situation. My setup uses a virtio-scsi device\n   and the  buffer allocated by SG is mapped by the function\n   virtqueue_add_split() which uses DMA_FROM_DEVICE for the \"in\" sgs (here\n   scatter-gather and not scsi generics). This mapping involves bouncing\n   via the swiotlb (we need swiotlb to do virtio in protected guest like\n   s390 Secure Execution, or AMD SEV).\n4) When the SCSI TUR is done, we first copy back the content of the second\n   (that is swiotlb) bounce buffer (which most likely contains some\n   previous IO data), to the first bounce buffer, which contains all\n   zeros.  Then we copy back the content of the first bounce buffer to\n   the user-space buffer.\n5) The test case detects that the buffer, which it zero-initialized,\n  ain't all zeros and fails.\n\nOne can argue that this is an swiotlb problem, because without swiotlb\nwe leak all zeros, and the swiotlb should be transparent in a sense that\nit does not affect the outcome (if all other participants are well\nbehaved).\n\nCopying the content of the original buffer into the swiotlb buffer is\nthe only way I can think of to make swiotlb transparent in such\nscenarios. So let's do just that if in doubt, but allow the driver\nto tell us that the whole mapped buffer is going to be overwritten,\nin which case we can preserve the old behavior and avoid the performance\nimpact of the extra bounce."

If this happens the socket will be in the connected table, and\nit is not removed when the socket state is reset. In this situation it's\ncommon for the process to retry connect(), and if the connection is\nsuccessful the socket will be added to the connected table a second\ntime, corrupting the list.\n\nPrevent this by calling vsock_remove_connected() if a signal is received\nwhile waiting for a connection. This is harmless if the socket is not in\nthe connected table, and if it is in the table then removing it will\nprevent list corruption from a double add.\n\nNote for backporting: this patch requires d5afa82c977e (\"vsock: correct\nremoval of socket from the list\"), which is in all current stable trees\nexcept 4.9.y."

If this happens the socket will be in the connected table, and\nit is not removed when the socket state is reset. In this situation it's\ncommon for the process to retry connect(), and if the connection is\nsuccessful the socket will be added to the connected table a second\ntime, corrupting the list.\n\nPrevent this by calling vsock_remove_connected() if a signal is received\nwhile waiting for a connection. This is harmless if the socket is not in\nthe connected table, and if it is in the table then removing it will\nprevent list corruption from a double add.\n\nNote for backporting: this patch requires d5afa82c977e (\"vsock: correct\nremoval of socket from the list\"), which is in all current stable trees\nexcept 4.9.y."

But it appears it\ndoes.  Suspicious.\n\nHowever, regardless of that, the condition for enabling NUMA faults in\nchange_pte_range() is nonsensical.  It uses \"page_mapcount(page)\" to\ndecide if a COW page should be NUMA-protected or not, and that makes\nabsolutely no sense.\n\nThe number of mappings a page has is irrelevant: not only does GUP get a\nreference to a page as in Oded's case, but the other mappings migth be\npaged out and the only reference to them would be in the page count.\n\nSince we should never try to NUMA-balance a page that we can't move\nanyway due to other references, just fix the code to use 'page_count()'.\nOded confirms that that fixes his issue.\n\nNow, this does imply that something in NUMA balancing ends up changing\npage protections (other than the obvious one of making the page\ninaccessible to get the NUMA faulting information).  Otherwise the COW\nsimplification wouldn't matter - since doing the GUP on the page would\nmake sure it's writable.\n\nThe cause of that permission change would be good to figure out too,\nsince it clearly results in spurious COW events - but fixing the\nnonsensical test that just happened to work before is obviously the\nCorrectThing(tm) to do regardless."

Unregistering the slave\ninterfaces is unnecessary and unhelpful. Instead, after the slaves have\nstopped being uppers of the DSA master, we can now reset to NULL the\nmaster->dsa_ptr pointer, which will make DSA start ignoring all future\nnotifier events on the master."

But there is one more which applies here.\n\nIf the DSA master itself is on a bus that calls ->remove from ->shutdown\n(like dpaa2-eth, which is on the fsl-mc bus), there is a device link\nbetween the switch and the DSA master, and device_links_unbind_consumers()\nwill unbind the Marvell switch driver on shutdown.\n\nsystemd-shutdown[1]: Powering off.\nmv88e6085 0x0000000008b96000:00 sw_gl0: Link is Down\nfsl-mc dpbp.9: Removing from iommu group 7\nfsl-mc dpbp.8: Removing from iommu group 7\n------------[ cut here ]------------\nkernel BUG at drivers/net/phy/mdio_bus.c:677!\nInternal error: Oops - BUG: 0 [#1] PREEMPT SMP\nModules linked in:\nCPU: 0 PID: 1 Comm: systemd-shutdow Not tainted 5.16.5-00040-gdc05f73788e5 #15\npc : mdiobus_free+0x44/0x50\nlr : devm_mdiobus_free+0x10/0x20\nCall trace:\n mdiobus_free+0x44/0x50\n devm_mdiobus_free+0x10/0x20\n devres_release_all+0xa0/0x100\n __device_release_driver+0x190/0x220\n device_release_driver_internal+0xac/0xb0\n device_links_unbind_consumers+0xd4/0x100\n __device_release_driver+0x4c/0x220\n device_release_driver_internal+0xac/0xb0\n device_links_unbind_consumers+0xd4/0x100\n __device_release_driver+0x94/0x220\n device_release_driver+0x28/0x40\n bus_remove_device+0x118/0x124\n device_del+0x174/0x420\n fsl_mc_device_remove+0x24/0x40\n __fsl_mc_device_remove+0xc/0x20\n device_for_each_child+0x58/0xa0\n dprc_remove+0x90/0xb0\n fsl_mc_driver_remove+0x20/0x5c\n __device_release_driver+0x21c/0x220\n device_release_driver+0x28/0x40\n bus_remove_device+0x118/0x124\n device_del+0x174/0x420\n fsl_mc_bus_remove+0x80/0x100\n fsl_mc_bus_shutdown+0xc/0x1c\n platform_shutdown+0x20/0x30\n device_shutdown+0x154/0x330\n kernel_power_off+0x34/0x6c\n __do_sys_reboot+0x15c/0x250\n __arm64_sys_reboot+0x20/0x30\n invoke_syscall.constprop.0+0x4c/0xe0\n do_el0_svc+0x4c/0x150\n el0_svc+0x24/0xb0\n el0t_64_sync_handler+0xa8/0xb0\n el0t_64_sync+0x178/0x17c\n\nSo the same treatment must be applied to all DSA switch drivers, which\nis: either use devres for both the mdiobus allocation and registration,\nor don't use devres at all.\n\nThe Marvell driver already has a good structure for mdiobus removal, so\njust plug in mdiobus_free and get rid of devres."
