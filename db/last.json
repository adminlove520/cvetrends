If curl is told to use an HTTP proxy for a transfer with a non-HTTP(S) URL, it sets up the connection to the remote server by issuing a CONNECT request to the proxy, and then tunnels the rest of the protocol through. An HTTP proxy might refuse this request (HTTP proxies often only allow outgoing connections to specific port numbers, like 443 for HTTPS) and instead return a non-200 status code to the client. Due to flaws in the error/cleanup handling, this could trigger a double free in curl if one of the following schemes were used in the URL for the transfer: dict, gopher, gophers, ldap, ldaps, rtmp, rtmps, or telnet. The earliest affected version is 7.77.0."

        "summary": "mailcow is a mail server suite based on Dovecot, Postfix and other open source software, that provides a modern web UI for user/server administration. A vulnerability has been discovered in mailcow which allows an attacker to manipulate internal Dovecot variables by using specially crafted passwords during the authentication process. The issue arises from the behavior of the `passwd-verify.lua` script, which is responsible for verifying user passwords during login attempts. Upon a successful login, the script returns a response in the format of \"password=<valid-password>\", indicating the successful authentication. By crafting a password with additional key-value pairs appended to it, an attacker can manipulate the returned string and influence the internal behavior of Dovecot. For example, using the password \"123 mail_crypt_save_version=0\" would cause the `passwd-verify.lua` script to return the string \"password=123 mail_crypt_save_version=0\". Consequently, Dovecot will interpret this string and set the internal variables accordingly, leading to unintended consequences. This vulnerability can be exploited by an authenticated attacker who has the ability to set their own password. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in unauthorized access to user accounts, bypassing security controls, or other malicious activities. This issue has been patched in version `2023-05a`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
