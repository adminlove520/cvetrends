        "summary": "angular-server-side-configuration helps configure an angular application at runtime on the server or in a docker container via environment variables. angular-server-side-configuration detects used environment variables in TypeScript (.ts) files during build time of an Angular CLI project. The detected environment variables are written to a ngssc.json file in the output directory. During deployment of an Angular based app, the environment variables based on the variables from ngssc.json are inserted into the apps index.html (or defined index file). With version 15.0.0 the environment variable detection was widened to the entire project, relative to the angular.json file from the Angular CLI. In a monorepo setup, this could lead to environment variables intended for a backend/service to be detected and written to the ngssc.json, which would then be populated and exposed via index.html. This has NO IMPACT, in a plain Angular project that has no backend component. This vulnerability has been mitigated in version 15.1.0, by adding an option `searchPattern` which restricts the detection file range by default. As a workaround, manually edit or create ngssc.json or run script after ngssc.json generation."

The ML models containing such vulnerable components could be deployed in ML applications or as cloud services. This failure could be potentially used to trigger a denial of service attack on ML cloud services. An attacker must have privilege to provide input to a `Convolution3DTranspose` call.

        "summary": "GoCD is an open source continuous delivery server. In GoCD versions from 20.5.0 and below 23.1.0, if the server environment is not correctly configured by administrators to provide access to the relevant PostgreSQL or MySQL backup tools, the credentials for database access may be unintentionally leaked to admin alerts on the GoCD user interface. The vulnerability is triggered only if the GoCD server host is misconfigured to have backups enabled, but does not have access to the `pg_dump` or `mysqldump` utility tools to backup the configured database type (PostgreSQL or MySQL respectively). In such cases, failure to launch the expected backup utility reports the shell environment used to attempt to launch in the server admin alert, which includes the plaintext database password supplied to the configured tool. This vulnerability does not affect backups of the default on-disk H2 database that GoCD is configured to use. This issue has been addressed and fixed in GoCD 23.1.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may disable backups, or administrators should ensure that the required `pg_dump` (PostgreSQL) or `mysqldump` (MySQL) binaries are available on the GoCD server when backups are triggered."

        "summary": "Snappier is a high performance C# implementation of the Snappy compression algorithm. This is a buffer overrun vulnerability that can affect any user of Snappier 1.1.0. In this release, much of the code was rewritten to use byte references rather than pointers to pinned buffers. This change generally improves performance and reduces workload on the garbage collector. However, when the garbage collector performs compaction and rearranges memory, it must update any byte references on the stack to refer to the updated location. The .NET garbage collector can only update these byte references if they still point within the buffer or to a point one byte past the end of the buffer. If they point outside this area, the buffer itself may be moved while the byte reference stays the same. There are several places in 1.1.0 where byte references very briefly point outside the valid areas of buffers. These are at locations in the code being used for buffer range checks. While the invalid references are never dereferenced directly, if a GC compaction were to occur during the brief window when they are on the stack then it could invalidate the buffer range check and allow other operations to overrun the buffer. This should be very difficult for an attacker to trigger intentionally. It would require a repetitive bulk attack with the hope that a GC compaction would occur at precisely the right moment during one of the requests. However, one of the range checks with this problem is a check based on input data in the decompression buffer, meaning malformed input data could be used to increase the chance of success. Note that any resulting buffer overrun is likely to cause access to protected memory, which will then cause an exception and the process to be terminated. Therefore, the most likely result of an attack is a denial of service. This issue has been patched in release 1.1.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may pin buffers to a fixed location before using them for compression or decompression to mitigate some, but not all, of these cases. At least one temporary decompression buffer is internal to the library and never pinned."
