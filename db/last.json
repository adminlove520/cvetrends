Using their membership to the \"adm\" group, users with this role are able to read the DHCP XID from the systemd journal. Using the DHCP XID, it is then possible to set the IP address and hostname of the instance to any value, which is then stored in /etc/hosts. An attacker can then point metadata.google.internal to an arbitrary IP address and impersonate the GCE metadata server which make it is possible to instruct the OS Login PAM module to grant administrative privileges. All images created after 2020-May-07 (20200507) are fixed, and if you cannot update, we recommend you edit /etc/group/security.conf and remove the \"adm\" user from the OS Login entry."

Prior to 0.51.2, if a malicious actor is able to trigger Trivy to scan container images from a crafted malicious registry, it could result in the leakage of credentials for legitimate registries such as AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR), Google Cloud Artifact/Container Registry, or Azure Container Registry (ACR). These tokens can then be used to push/pull images from those registries to which the identity/user running Trivy has access. Systems are not affected if the default credential provider chain is unable to obtain valid credentials. This vulnerability only applies when scanning container images directly from a registry. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.51.2."

Prior to version 0.0.50, Minder engine is susceptible to a denial of service from memory exhaustion that can be triggered from maliciously created templates. Minder engine uses templating to generate strings for various use cases such as URLs, messages for pull requests, descriptions for advisories. In some cases can the user control both the template and the params for it, and in a subset of these cases, Minder reads the generated template entirely into memory. When Minders templating meets both of these conditions, an attacker is able to generate large enough templates that Minder will exhaust memory and crash. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.0.50."

The memory itself of such item is not freed thanks to RCU\nbut nothing guarantees the actual content of the memory is sane.\n\nIn particular, the reference count can be zero. This can happen if\nipv6_del_addr is called in parallel. ipv6_del_addr removes the entry\nfrom inet6_addr_lst (hlist_del_init_rcu(&ifp->addr_lst)) and drops all\nreferences (__in6_ifa_put(ifp) + in6_ifa_put(ifp)). With bad enough\ntiming, this can happen:\n\n1. In ipv6_get_ifaddr, hlist_for_each_entry_rcu returns an entry.\n\n2. Then, the whole ipv6_del_addr is executed for the given entry. The\n   reference count drops to zero and kfree_rcu is scheduled.\n\n3. ipv6_get_ifaddr continues and tries to increments the reference count\n   (in6_ifa_hold).\n\n4. The rcu is unlocked and the entry is freed.\n\n5. The freed entry is returned.\n\nPrevent increasing of the reference count in such case.

When quota groups (squota or qgroups)\nare enabled, this reserves qgroup metadata of type PREALLOC. Once the\noperation is associated to a transaction, we convert PREALLOC to\nPERTRANS, which gets cleared in bulk at the end of the transaction.\n\nHowever, the error paths of these three operations were not implementing\nthis lifecycle correctly. They unconditionally converted the PREALLOC to\nPERTRANS in a generic cleanup step regardless of errors or whether the\noperation was fully associated to a transaction or not. This resulted in\nerror paths occasionally converting this rsv to PERTRANS without calling\nrecord_root_in_trans successfully, which meant that unless that root got\nrecorded in the transaction by some other thread, the end of the\ntransaction would not free that root's PERTRANS, leaking it. Ultimately,\nthis resulted in hitting a WARN in CONFIG_BTRFS_DEBUG builds at unmount\nfor the leaked reservation.\n\nThe fix is to ensure that every qgroup PREALLOC reservation observes the\nfollowing properties:\n\n1. any failure before record_root_in_trans is called successfully\n   results in freeing the PREALLOC reservation.\n2. after record_root_in_trans, we convert to PERTRANS, and now the\n   transaction owns freeing the reservation.\n\nThis patch enforces those properties on the three operations. Without\nit, generic/269 with squotas enabled at mkfs time would fail in ~5-10\nruns on my system. With this patch, it ran successfully 1000 times in a\nrow."

Failure to adhere to this has (so far) resulted\nin either no response being written to the response buffer (causing an\nEIO to be emitted down the line), the SCM call to fail with EINVAL\n(i.e., directly from TZ/firmware), or the device to be hard-reset.\n\nWhile this issue can be triggered deterministically, in the current form\nit seems to happen rather sporadically (which is why it has gone\nunnoticed during earlier testing). This is likely due to the two\nkzalloc() calls (for request and response) being directly after each\nother. Which means that those likely return consecutive regions most of\nthe time, especially when not much else is going on in the system.\n\nFix this by allocating a single memory region for both request and\nresponse buffers, properly aligning both structs inside it. This\nunfortunately also means that the qcom_scm_qseecom_app_send() interface\nneeds to be restructured, as it should no longer map the DMA regions\nseparately. Therefore, move the responsibility of DMA allocation (or\nmapping) to the caller."

One of the softirqs is net_rx_action, which ultimately\nreaches the driver .start_xmit callback. If that happens, the system\nhangs. The entire call chain is below:\n\nks8851_start_xmit_par from netdev_start_xmit\nnetdev_start_xmit from dev_hard_start_xmit\ndev_hard_start_xmit from sch_direct_xmit\nsch_direct_xmit from __dev_queue_xmit\n__dev_queue_xmit from __neigh_update\n__neigh_update from neigh_update\nneigh_update from arp_process.constprop.0\narp_process.constprop.0 from __netif_receive_skb_one_core\n__netif_receive_skb_one_core from process_backlog\nprocess_backlog from __napi_poll.constprop.0\n__napi_poll.constprop.0 from net_rx_action\nnet_rx_action from __do_softirq\n__do_softirq from call_with_stack\ncall_with_stack from do_softirq\ndo_softirq from __local_bh_enable_ip\n__local_bh_enable_ip from netif_rx\nnetif_rx from ks8851_irq\nks8851_irq from irq_thread_fn\nirq_thread_fn from irq_thread\nirq_thread from kthread\nkthread from ret_from_fork\n\nThe hang happens because ks8851_irq() first locks a spinlock in\nks8851_par.c ks8851_lock_par() spin_lock_irqsave(&ksp->lock, ...)\nand with that spinlock locked, calls netif_rx(). Once the execution\nreaches ks8851_start_xmit_par(), it calls ks8851_lock_par() again\nwhich attempts to claim the already locked spinlock again, and the\nhang happens.\n\nMove the do_softirq() call outside of the spinlock protected section\nof ks8851_irq() by disabling BHs around the entire spinlock protected\nsection of ks8851_irq() handler. Place local_bh_enable() outside of\nthe spinlock protected section, so that it can trigger do_softirq()\nwithout the ks8851_par.c ks8851_lock_par() spinlock being held, and\nsafely call ks8851_start_xmit_par() without attempting to lock the\nalready locked spinlock.\n\nSince ks8851_irq() is protected by local_bh_disable()/local_bh_enable()\nnow, replace netif_rx() with __netif_rx() which is not duplicating the\nlocal_bh_disable()/local_bh_enable() calls."
