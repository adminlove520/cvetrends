        "summary": "A heap-based buffer overflow issue was discovered in libjpeg-turbo in h2v2_merged_upsample_internal() function of jdmrgext.c file. The vulnerability can only be exploited with 12-bit data precision for which the range of the sample data type exceeds the valid sample range, hence, an attacker could craft a 12-bit lossless JPEG image that contains out-of-range 12-bit samples. An application attempting to decompress such image using merged upsampling would lead to segmentation fault or buffer overflows, causing an application to crash."

The manipulation of the argument spkt.buf/rpkt.buf leads to improper validation of array index. The real existence of this vulnerability is still doubted at the moment. The name of the patch is a75fb7b198eed50d769c80c36629f38346882cbf. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. VDB-216198 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability. NOTE: pppdump is not used in normal process of setting up a PPP connection, is not installed setuid-root, and is not invoked automatically in any scenario."
