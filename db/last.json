The TLVs themselves are divided into two sections, a protected and an unprotected section. The protected TLV entries are included as part of the image signature to avoid tampering. However, the code does not distinguish which TLV entries should be protected or not, so it is possible for an attacker to add unprotected TLV entries that should be protected. Currently, the primary protected TLV entries should be the dependency indication, and the boot record. An injected dependency value would primarily result in an otherwise acceptable image being rejected. A boot record injection could allow fields in a later attestation record to include data not intended, which could cause an image to appear to have properties that it should not have. As a workaround, disable the boot record functionality. "

        "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmlxsw: spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix stack corruption\n\nWhen tc filters are first added to a net device, the corresponding local\nport gets bound to an ACL group in the device. The group contains a list\nof ACLs. In turn, each ACL points to a different TCAM region where the\nfilters are stored. During forwarding, the ACLs are sequentially\nevaluated until a match is found.\n\nOne reason to place filters in different regions is when they are added\nwith decreasing priorities and in an alternating order so that two\nconsecutive filters can never fit in the same region because of their\nkey usage.\n\nIn Spectrum-2 and newer ASICs the firmware started to report that the\nmaximum number of ACLs in a group is more than 16, but the layout of the\nregister that configures ACL groups (PAGT) was not updated to account\nfor that. It is therefore possible to hit stack corruption [1] in the\nrare case where more than 16 ACLs in a group are required.\n\nFix by limiting the maximum ACL group size to the minimum between what\nthe firmware reports and the maximum ACLs that fit in the PAGT register.\n\nAdd a test case to make sure the machine does not crash when this\ncondition is hit.\n\n[1]\nKernel panic - not syncing: stack-protector: Kernel stack is corrupted in: mlxsw_sp_acl_tcam_group_update+0x116/0x120\n[...]\n dump_stack_lvl+0x36/0x50\n panic+0x305/0x330\n __stack_chk_fail+0x15/0x20\n mlxsw_sp_acl_tcam_group_update+0x116/0x120\n mlxsw_sp_acl_tcam_group_region_attach+0x69/0x110\n mlxsw_sp_acl_tcam_vchunk_get+0x492/0xa20\n mlxsw_sp_acl_tcam_ventry_add+0x25/0xe0\n mlxsw_sp_acl_rule_add+0x47/0x240\n mlxsw_sp_flower_replace+0x1a9/0x1d0\n tc_setup_cb_add+0xdc/0x1c0\n fl_hw_replace_filter+0x146/0x1f0\n fl_change+0xc17/0x1360\n tc_new_tfilter+0x472/0xb90\n rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x313/0x3b0\n netlink_rcv_skb+0x58/0x100\n netlink_unicast+0x244/0x390\n netlink_sendmsg+0x1e4/0x440\n ____sys_sendmsg+0x164/0x260\n ___sys_sendmsg+0x9a/0xe0\n __sys_sendmsg+0x7a/0xc0\n do_syscall_64+0x40/0xe0\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0x6b"

NOTE: some parties have mapped the recursive Reflection API issue to CVE-2012-3174, but CVE-2012-3174 is for a different vulnerability whose details are not public as of 20130114.  CVE-2013-0422 covers both the JMX/MBean and Reflection API issues.  NOTE: it was originally reported that Java 6 was also vulnerable, but the reporter has retracted this claim, stating that Java 6 is not exploitable because the relevant code is called in a way that does not bypass security checks.  NOTE: as of 20130114, a reliable third party has claimed that the findClass/MBeanInstantiator vector was not fixed in Oracle Java 7 Update 11.  If there is still a vulnerable condition, then a separate CVE identifier might be created for the unfixed issue."
