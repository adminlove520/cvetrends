A successful exploit allows attackers to run arbitrary commands on the host system where the Snyk CLI is installed by passing in crafted command line flags. In order to exploit this vulnerability, a user would have to execute the snyk test command on untrusted files. In most cases, an attacker positioned to control the command line arguments to the Snyk CLI would already be positioned to execute arbitrary commands. However, this could be abused in specific scenarios, such as continuous integration pipelines, where developers can control the arguments passed to the Snyk CLI to leverage this component as part of a wider attack against an integration/build pipeline. This issue has been addressed in the latest Snyk Docker images available at https://hub.docker.com/r/snyk/snyk as of 2022-11-29. Images downloaded and built prior to that date should be updated. The issue has also been addressed in the Snyk TeamCity CI/CD plugin as of version v20221130.093605."

An attacker who can convince a user to scan a malicious project can include commands in a build file such as build.gradle or gradle-wrapper.jar, which will be executed with the privileges of the application. This vulnerability may be triggered when running the the CLI tool directly, or when running a scan with one of the IDE plugins that invoke the Snyk CLI. Successful exploitation of this issue would likely require some level of social engineering - to coerce an untrusted project to be downloaded and analyzed via the Snyk CLI or opened in an IDE where a Snyk IDE plugin is installed and enabled. Additionally, if the IDE has a Trust feature then the target folder must be marked as \u2018trusted\u2019 in order to be vulnerable. **NOTE:** This issue is independent of the one reported in [CVE-2022-40764](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-SNYK-3037342), and upgrading to a fixed version for this addresses that issue as well. The affected IDE plugins and versions are: - VS Code - Affected: <=1.8.0, Fixed: 1.9.0 - IntelliJ - Affected: <=2.4.47, Fixed: 2.4.48 - Visual Studio - Affected: <=1.1.30, Fixed: 1.1.31 - Eclipse - Affected: <=v20221115.132308, Fixed: All subsequent versions - Language Server - Affected: <=v20221109.114426, Fixed: All subsequent versions"

An unnecessary quadratic algorithm exists in one path when processing some inputs to the IDNA (RFC 3490) decoder, such that a crafted, unreasonably long name being presented to the decoder could lead to a CPU denial of service. Hostnames are often supplied by remote servers that could be controlled by a malicious actor; in such a scenario, they could trigger excessive CPU consumption on the client attempting to make use of an attacker-supplied supposed hostname. For example, the attack payload could be placed in the Location header of an HTTP response with status code 302. A fix is planned in 3.11.1, 3.10.9, 3.9.16, 3.8.16, and 3.7.16."

        "summary": "Airtable.js is the JavaScript client for Airtable. Prior to version 0.11.6, Airtable.js had a misconfigured build script in its source package. When the build script is run, it would bundle environment variables into the build target of a transpiled bundle. Specifically, the AIRTABLE_API_KEY and AIRTABLE_ENDPOINT_URL environment variables are inserted during Browserify builds due to being referenced in Airtable.js code. This only affects copies of Airtable.js built from its source, not those installed via npm or yarn. Airtable API keys set in users\u2019 environments via the AIRTABLE_API_KEY environment variable may be bundled into local copies of Airtable.js source code if all of the following conditions are met: 1) the user has cloned the Airtable.js source onto their machine, 2) the user runs the `npm prepare` script, and 3) the user' has the AIRTABLE_API_KEY environment variable set. If these conditions are met, a user\u2019s local build of Airtable.js would be modified to include the value of the AIRTABLE_API_KEY environment variable, which could then be accidentally shipped in the bundled code. Users who do not meet all three of these conditions are not impacted by this issue. Users should upgrade to Airtable.js version 0.11.6 or higher; or, as a workaround unset the AIRTABLE_API_KEY environment variable in their shell and/or remove it from your .bashrc, .zshrc, or other shell configuration files. Users should also regenerate any Airtable API keys they use, as the keysy may be present in bundled code."
