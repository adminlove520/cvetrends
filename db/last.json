If the user\nsets the permissions, then a flag is set and the permissions are saved via\nthe inode (for tracefs files) or an internal attribute field (for\neventfs).\n\nBut if a remount happens that specify the permissions, all the files that\nwere not changed by the user gets updated, but the ones that were are not.\nIf the user were to remount the file system with a given permission, then\nall files and directories within that file system should be updated.\n\nThis can cause security issues if a file's permission was updated but the\nadmin forgot about it. They could incorrectly think that remounting with\npermissions set would update all files, but miss some.\n\nFor example:\n\n # cd /sys/kernel/tracing\n # chgrp 1002 current_tracer\n # ls -l\n[..]\n -rw-r-----  1 root root 0 May  1 21:25 buffer_size_kb\n -rw-r-----  1 root root 0 May  1 21:25 buffer_subbuf_size_kb\n -r--r-----  1 root root 0 May  1 21:25 buffer_total_size_kb\n -rw-r-----  1 root lkp  0 May  1 21:25 current_tracer\n -rw-r-----  1 root root 0 May  1 21:25 dynamic_events\n -r--r-----  1 root root 0 May  1 21:25 dyn_ftrace_total_info\n -r--r-----  1 root root 0 May  1 21:25 enabled_functions\n\nWhere current_tracer now has group \"lkp\".\n\n # mount -o remount,gid=1001 .\n # ls -l\n -rw-r-----  1 root tracing 0 May  1 21:25 buffer_size_kb\n -rw-r-----  1 root tracing 0 May  1 21:25 buffer_subbuf_size_kb\n -r--r-----  1 root tracing 0 May  1 21:25 buffer_total_size_kb\n -rw-r-----  1 root lkp     0 May  1 21:25 current_tracer\n -rw-r-----  1 root tracing 0 May  1 21:25 dynamic_events\n -r--r-----  1 root tracing 0 May  1 21:25 dyn_ftrace_total_info\n -r--r-----  1 root tracing 0 May  1 21:25 enabled_functions\n\nEverything changed but the \"current_tracer\".\n\nAdd a new link list that keeps track of all the tracefs_inodes which has\nthe permission flags that tell if the file/dir should use the root inode's\npermission or not.
