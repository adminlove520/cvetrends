An internal security audit has been conducted and the reviewers found that if they manipulated the value of the mod_auth_openidc_session_chunks cookie to a very large integer, like 99999999, the server struggles with the request for a long time and finally gets back with a 500 error. Making a few requests of this kind caused our server to become unresponsive. Attackers can craft requests that would make the server work very hard (and possibly become unresponsive) and/or crash with minimal effort. This issue has been addressed in version 2.4.15.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."

Only the new dentry is supposed to exist.\n\nGenerally this works correctly, however there is a scenario where this is\nnot currently working, because the old parent of the file/directory that\nwas moved is not authoritative for a range that includes the dir index and\ndir item keys of the old dentry. This case is better explained with the\nfollowing example and reproducer:\n\n  # The test requires a very specific layout of keys and items in the\n  # fs/subvolume btree to trigger the bug. So we want to make sure that\n  # on whatever platform we are, we have the same leaf/node size.\n  #\n  # Currently in btrfs the node/leaf size can not be smaller than the page\n  # size (but it can be greater than the page size).

The\nsender (do_mq_timedsend) uses this address to later call pipelined_send.\n\nThis leads to a very hard to trigger race where a do_mq_timedreceive\ncall might return and leave do_mq_timedsend to rely on an invalid\naddress, causing the following crash:\n\n  RIP: 0010:wake_q_add_safe+0x13/0x60\n  Call Trace:\n   __x64_sys_mq_timedsend+0x2a9/0x490\n   do_syscall_64+0x80/0x680\n   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xa9\n  RIP: 0033:0x7f5928e40343\n\nThe race occurs as:\n\n1. do_mq_timedreceive calls wq_sleep with the address of `struct\n   ext_wait_queue` on function stack (aliased as `ewq_addr` here) - it\n   holds a valid `struct ext_wait_queue *` as long as the stack has not\n   been overwritten.\n\n2. `ewq_addr` gets added to info->e_wait_q[RECV].list in wq_add, and\n   do_mq_timedsend receives it via wq_get_first_waiter(info, RECV) to call\n   __pipelined_op.\n\n3. Sender calls __pipelined_op::smp_store_release(&this->state,\n   STATE_READY).  Here is where the race window begins.  (`this` is\n   `ewq_addr`.)\n\n4. If the receiver wakes up now in do_mq_timedreceive::wq_sleep, it\n   will see `state == STATE_READY` and break.\n\n5. do_mq_timedreceive returns, and `ewq_addr` is no longer guaranteed\n   to be a `struct ext_wait_queue *` since it was on do_mq_timedreceive's\n   stack.  (Although the address may not get overwritten until another\n   function happens to touch it, which means it can persist around for an\n   indefinite time.)\n\n6. do_mq_timedsend::__pipelined_op() still believes `ewq_addr` is a\n   `struct ext_wait_queue *`, and uses it to find a task_struct to pass to\n   the wake_q_add_safe call.  In the lucky case where nothing has\n   overwritten `ewq_addr` yet, `ewq_addr->task` is the right task_struct.\n   In the unlucky case, __pipelined_op::wake_q_add_safe gets handed a\n   bogus address as the receiver's task_struct causing the crash.\n\ndo_mq_timedsend::__pipelined_op() should not dereference `this` after\nsetting STATE_READY, as the receiver counterpart is now free to return.\nChange __pipelined_op to call wake_q_add_safe on the receiver's\ntask_struct returned by get_task_struct, instead of dereferencing `this`\nwhich sits on the receiver's stack.\n\nAs Manfred pointed out, the race potentially also exists in\nipc/msg.c::expunge_all and ipc/sem.c::wake_up_sem_queue_prepare.  Fix\nthose in the same way."
