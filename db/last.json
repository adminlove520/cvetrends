Thus causing a deadlock.\n\nIn the first place, it is unexpected that folios/pages in the middle of\nwriteback will be updated and become dirty.  Nilfs2 adds a checksum to\nverify the validity of the log being written and uses it for recovery at\nmount, so data changes during writeback are suppressed.  Since this is\nbroken, an unclean shutdown could potentially cause recovery to fail.\n\nInvestigation revealed that the root cause is that the wait for writeback\ncompletion in nilfs_page_mkwrite() is conditional, and if the backing\ndevice does not require stable writes, data may be modified without\nwaiting.\n\nFix these issues by making nilfs_page_mkwrite() wait for writeback to\nfinish regardless of the stable write requirement of the backing device."

The data\nsize is specified as `len` and passed to skb_put_data(). This `len`\nis based on `skb->end` that is not data offset but buffer offset. The\n`skb->end` contains data and tailroom. Since the tailroom is not\ninitialized when the new `skb` created, KMSAN detects uninitialized\nmemory area when copying the data.\n\nThis patch resolved this issue by correct the len from `skb->end` to\n`skb->len`, which is the actual data offset.\n\nBUG: KMSAN: kernel-infoleak-after-free in instrument_copy_to_user include/linux/instrumented.h:114 [inline]\nBUG: KMSAN: kernel-infoleak-after-free in copy_to_user_iter lib/iov_iter.c:24 [inline]\nBUG: KMSAN: kernel-infoleak-after-free in iterate_ubuf include/linux/iov_iter.h:29 [inline]\nBUG: KMSAN: kernel-infoleak-after-free in iterate_and_advance2 include/linux/iov_iter.h:245 [inline]\nBUG: KMSAN: kernel-infoleak-after-free in iterate_and_advance include/linux/iov_iter.h:271 [inline]\nBUG: KMSAN: kernel-infoleak-after-free in _copy_to_iter+0x364/0x2520 lib/iov_iter.c:186\n instrument_copy_to_user include/linux/instrumented.h:114 [inline]\n copy_to_user_iter lib/iov_iter.c:24 [inline]\n iterate_ubuf include/linux/iov_iter.h:29 [inline]\n iterate_and_advance2 include/linux/iov_iter.h:245 [inline]\n iterate_and_advance include/linux/iov_iter.h:271 [inline]\n _copy_to_iter+0x364/0x2520 lib/iov_iter.c:186\n copy_to_iter include/linux/uio.h:197 [inline]\n simple_copy_to_iter+0x68/0xa0 net/core/datagram.c:532\n __skb_datagram_iter+0x123/0xdc0 net/core/datagram.c:420\n skb_copy_datagram_iter+0x5c/0x200 net/core/datagram.c:546\n skb_copy_datagram_msg include/linux/skbuff.h:3960 [inline]\n packet_recvmsg+0xd9c/0x2000 net/packet/af_packet.c:3482\n sock_recvmsg_nosec net/socket.c:1044 [inline]\n sock_recvmsg net/socket.c:1066 [inline]\n sock_read_iter+0x467/0x580 net/socket.c:1136\n call_read_iter include/linux/fs.h:2014 [inline]\n new_sync_read fs/read_write.c:389 [inline]\n vfs_read+0x8f6/0xe00 fs/read_write.c:470\n ksys_read+0x20f/0x4c0 fs/read_write.c:613\n __do_sys_read fs/read_write.c:623 [inline]\n __se_sys_read fs/read_write.c:621 [inline]\n __x64_sys_read+0x93/0xd0 fs/read_write.c:621\n do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/common.c:52 [inline]\n do_syscall_64+0x44/0x110 arch/x86/entry/common.c:83\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0x6b\n\nUninit was stored to memory at:\n skb_put_data include/linux/skbuff.h:2622 [inline]\n netlink_to_full_skb net/netlink/af_netlink.c:181 [inline]\n __netlink_deliver_tap_skb net/netlink/af_netlink.c:298 [inline]\n __netlink_deliver_tap+0x5be/0xc90 net/netlink/af_netlink.c:325\n netlink_deliver_tap net/netlink/af_netlink.c:338 [inline]\n netlink_deliver_tap_kernel net/netlink/af_netlink.c:347 [inline]\n netlink_unicast_kernel net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1341 [inline]\n netlink_unicast+0x10f1/0x1250 net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1368\n netlink_sendmsg+0x1238/0x13d0 net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1910\n sock_sendmsg_nosec net/socket.c:730 [inline]\n __sock_sendmsg net/socket.c:745 [inline]\n ____sys_sendmsg+0x9c2/0xd60 net/socket.c:2584\n ___sys_sendmsg+0x28d/0x3c0 net/socket.c:2638\n __sys_sendmsg net/socket.c:2667 [inline]\n __do_sys_sendmsg net/socket.c:2676 [inline]\n __se_sys_sendmsg net/socket.c:2674 [inline]\n __x64_sys_sendmsg+0x307/0x490 net/socket.c:2674\n do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/common.c:52 [inline]\n do_syscall_64+0x44/0x110 arch/x86/entry/common.c:83\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0x6b\n\nUninit was created at:\n free_pages_prepare mm/page_alloc.c:1087 [inline]\n free_unref_page_prepare+0xb0/0xa40 mm/page_alloc.c:2347\n free_unref_page_list+0xeb/0x1100 mm/page_alloc.c:2533\n release_pages+0x23d3/0x2410 mm/swap.c:1042\n free_pages_and_swap_cache+0xd9/0xf0 mm/swap_state.c:316\n tlb_batch_pages\n---truncated---"

It only guarantees that the suspend and resume callbacks\nwill not be running when it returns.\n\nHowever, if a .runtime_idle() callback is already running when\npm_runtime_get_sync() is called, the latter will notice that the runtime PM\nstatus of the device is RPM_ACTIVE and it will return right away without\nwaiting for the former to complete.  In fact, it cannot wait for\n.runtime_idle() to complete because it may be called from that callback (it\narguably does not make much sense to do that, but it is not strictly\nprohibited).\n\nThus in general, whoever is providing a .runtime_idle() callback needs\nto protect it from running in parallel with whatever code runs after\npm_runtime_get_sync().  [Note that .runtime_idle() will not start after\npm_runtime_get_sync() has returned, but it may continue running then if it\nhas started earlier.]\n\nOne way to address that race condition is to call pm_runtime_barrier()\nafter pm_runtime_get_sync() (not before it, because a nonzero value of the\nruntime PM usage counter is necessary to prevent runtime PM callbacks from\nbeing invoked) to wait for the .runtime_idle() callback to complete should\nit be running at that point.  A suitable place for doing that is in\npci_device_remove() which calls pm_runtime_get_sync() before removing the\ndriver, so it may as well call pm_runtime_barrier() subsequently, which\nwill prevent the race in question from occurring, not just in the rtsx_pcr\ndriver, but in any PCI drivers providing .runtime_idle() callbacks."

But usb_deauthorize_interface() can't complete\nuntil the device lock has been released, and the lock won't be\nreleased until the removal has finished.\n\nThe mechanism provided by sysfs to prevent this kind of deadlock is\nto use the sysfs_break_active_protection() function, which tells sysfs\nnot to wait for the attribute callback.\n\nReported-and-tested by: Yue Sun <samsun1006219@gmail.com>\nReported by: xingwei lee <xrivendell7@gmail.com>"

This could cause, amongst other bad\npossibilities, swap_page_trans_huge_swapped() (called by\nfree_swap_and_cache()) to access the freed memory for swap_map.\n\nThis is a theoretical problem and I haven't been able to provoke it from a\ntest case.  But there has been agreement based on code review that this is\npossible (see link below).\n\nFix it by using get_swap_device()/put_swap_device(), which will stall\nswapoff().  There was an extra check in _swap_info_get() to confirm that\nthe swap entry was not free.  This isn't present in get_swap_device()\nbecause it doesn't make sense in general due to the race between getting\nthe reference and swapoff.  So I've added an equivalent check directly in\nfree_swap_and_cache().\n\nDetails of how to provoke one possible issue (thanks to David Hildenbrand\nfor deriving this):\n\n--8<-----\n\n__swap_entry_free() might be the last user and result in\n\"count == SWAP_HAS_CACHE\".\n\nswapoff->try_to_unuse() will stop as soon as soon as si->inuse_pages==0.\n\nSo the question is: could someone reclaim the folio and turn\nsi->inuse_pages==0, before we completed swap_page_trans_huge_swapped().\n\nImagine the following: 2 MiB folio in the swapcache. Only 2 subpages are\nstill references by swap entries.\n\nProcess 1 still references subpage 0 via swap entry.\nProcess 2 still references subpage 1 via swap entry.\n\nProcess 1 quits.

Calls free_swap_and_cache().\n-> count == SWAP_HAS_CACHE\n\nProcess 2 goes ahead, passes swap_page_trans_huge_swapped(), and calls\n__try_to_reclaim_swap().\n\n__try_to_reclaim_swap()->folio_free_swap()->delete_from_swap_cache()->\nput_swap_folio()->free_swap_slot()->swapcache_free_entries()->\nswap_entry_free()->swap_range_free()->\n...\nWRITE_ONCE(si->inuse_pages, si->inuse_pages - nr_entries);\n\nWhat stops swapoff to succeed after process 2 reclaimed the swap cache\nbut before process1 finished its call to swap_page_trans_huge_swapped()?\n\n--8<-----"

And that in turn fixes the module\nunloading bug as __fput() won't do module_put() on the last vCPU reference\nuntil the vCPU has been freed, e.g. if closing the vCPU file also puts the\nlast reference to the KVM module.\n\nNote that kvm_check_async_pf_completion() may also take the work item off\nthe completion queue and so also needs to flush the work queue, as the\nwork will not be seen by kvm_clear_async_pf_completion_queue().  Waiting\non the workqueue could theoretically delay a vCPU due to waiting for the\nwork to complete, but that's a very, very small chance, and likely a very\nsmall delay.  kvm_arch_async_page_present_queued() unconditionally makes a\nnew request, i.e. will effectively delay entering the guest, so the\nremaining work is really just:\n\n        trace_kvm_async_pf_completed(addr, cr2_or_gpa);\n\n        __kvm_vcpu_wake_up(vcpu);\n\n        mmput(mm);\n\nand mmput() can't drop the last reference to the page tables if the vCPU is\nstill alive, i.e. the vCPU won't get stuck tearing down page tables.\n\nAdd a helper to do the flushing, specifically to deal with \"wakeup all\"\nwork items, as they aren't actually work items, i.e. are never placed in a\nworkqueue.  Trying to flush a bogus workqueue entry rightly makes\n__flush_work() complain (kudos to whoever added that sanity check).\n\nNote, commit 5f6de5cbebee (\"KVM: Prevent module exit until al\n---truncated---"
