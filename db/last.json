In pull request 1149, sanitation was added for Trix attachments with a `text/html` content type. However, Trix only checks the content type on the paste event's `dataTransfer` object. As long as the `dataTransfer` has a content type of `text/html`, Trix parses its contents and creates an `Attachment` with them, even if the attachment itself doesn't have a `text/html` content type. Trix then uses the attachment content to set the attachment element's `innerHTML`. An attacker could trick a user to copy and paste malicious code that would execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's session, potentially leading to unauthorized actions being performed or sensitive information being disclosed. This vulnerability was fixed in version 2.1.4."

When WebOb normalizes the HTTP Location header to include the request hostname, it does so by parsing the URL that the user is to be redirected to with Python's urlparse, and joining it to the base URL. `urlparse` however treats a `//` at the start of a string as a URI without a scheme, and then treats the next part as the hostname. `urljoin` will then use that hostname from the second part as the hostname replacing the original one from the request. This vulnerability is patched in WebOb version 1.8.8."

Upon receiving a new SIP Invite, Asterisk did not return the created dialog locked or referenced. This caused a gap between the creation of the dialog object, and its next use by the thread that created it. Depending on some off-nominal circumstances and timing, it was possible for another thread to free said dialog in this gap. Asterisk could then crash when the dialog object, or any of its dependent objects, were dereferenced or accessed next by the initial-creation thread. Note, however, that this crash can only occur when using a connection-oriented protocol (e.g., TCP or TLS, but not UDP) for SIP transport. Also, the remote client must be authenticated, or Asterisk must be configured for anonymous calling."
