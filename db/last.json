This creates a situation where `verifySignature()` can be tricked into validating the certificate of a different file than the one that was just downloaded. If the step is successful, the malicious update will be executed even if its signature is invalid. This attack assumes a compromised update manifest (server compromise, Man-in-the-Middle attack if fetched over HTTP, Cross-Site Scripting to point the application to a malicious updater server, etc.).

The namespace\ncleanup can destroy the list:set type of sets while the gc of the set type is\nwaiting to run in rcu cleanup. The latter uses data from the destroyed set which\nthus leads use after free. The patch contains the following parts:\n\n- When destroying all sets, first remove the garbage collectors, then wait\n  if needed and then destroy the sets.\n- Fix the badly ordered \"wait then remove gc\" for the destroy a single set\n  case.\n- Fix the missing rcu locking in the list:set type in the userspace test\n  case.\n- Use proper RCU list handlings in the list:set type.\n\nThe patch depends on c1193d9bbbd3 (netfilter: ipset: Add list flush to cancel_gc)."
