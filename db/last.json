This will cause a\nnew entry in idev->mc_tomb to be allocated for each multicast group\nthe interface is subscribed to, which in turn leaks one struct ifmcaddr6\nper nontrivial multicast group the interface is subscribed to.\n\nThe following reproducer will leak at least $n objects:\n\nip addr add ff2e::4242/32 dev eth0 autojoin\nsysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.eth0.disable_ipv6=1\nfor i in $(seq 1 $n); do\n\tip link set up eth0; ip link set down eth0\ndone\n\nJoining groups with IPV6_ADD_MEMBERSHIP (unprivileged) or setting the\nsysctl net.ipv6.conf.eth0.forwarding to 1 (=> subscribing to ff02::2)\ncan also be used to create a nontrivial idev->mc_list, which will the\nleak objects with the right up-down-sequence.\n\nBased on both sources for NETDEV_DOWN events the interface IPv6 state\nshould be considered:\n\n - not ready if the network interface is not ready OR IPv6 is disabled\n   for it\n - ready if the network interface is ready AND IPv6 is enabled for it\n\nThe functions ipv6_mc_up() and ipv6_down() should only be run when this\nstate changes.\n\nImplement this by remembering when the IPv6 state is ready, and only\nrun ipv6_mc_down() if it actually changed from ready to not ready.\n\nThe other direction (not ready -> ready) already works correctly, as:\n\n - the interface notification triggered codepath for NETDEV_UP /\n   NETDEV_CHANGE returns early if ipv6 is disabled, and\n - the disable_ipv6=0 triggered codepath skips fully initializing the\n   interface as long as addrconf_link_ready(dev) returns false\n - calling ipv6_mc_up() repeatedly does not leak anything"

This change was made\nby commit ce8ea7cc6eb313 (\"btrfs: don't call btrfs_start_delalloc_roots\nin flushoncommit\"). After that change we started producing that warning,\nand every now and then a user reports this since the warning happens too\noften, it spams dmesg/syslog, and a user is unsure if this reflects any\nproblem that might compromise the filesystem's reliability.\n\nWe can not just lock the sb->s_umount semaphore before calling\nwriteback_inodes_sb(), because that would at least deadlock with\nfilesystem freezing, since at fs/super.c:freeze_super() sync_filesystem()\nis called while we are holding that semaphore in write mode, and that can\ntrigger a transaction commit, resulting in a deadlock. It would also\ntrigger the same type of deadlock in the unmount path. Possibly, it could\nalso introduce some other locking dependencies that lockdep would report.\n\nTo fix this call try_to_writeback_inodes_sb() instead of\nwriteback_inodes_sb(), because that will try to read lock sb->s_umount\nand then will only call writeback_inodes_sb() if it was able to lock it.\nThis is fine because the cases where it can't read lock sb->s_umount\nare during a filesystem unmount or during a filesystem freeze - in those\ncases sb->s_umount is write locked and sync_filesystem() is called, which\ncalls writeback_inodes_sb(). In other words, in all cases where we can't\ntake a read lock on sb->s_umount, writeback is already being triggered\nelsewhere.\n\nAn alternative would be to call btrfs_start_delalloc_roots() with a\nnumber of pages different from LONG_MAX, for example matching the number\nof delalloc bytes we currently have, in \n---truncated---"

The scenario is that the main process spawns\nnumber of new threads, which then call setpriority(PRIO_PGRP, 0, -20),\nwait, and exit.  For each of the new threads the copy_process() gets\ninvoked, which adds the new task_struct and calls sched_post_fork()\nfor it.\n\nIn the above scenario there is a possibility that\nsetpriority(PRIO_PGRP) and set_one_prio() will be called for a thread\nin the group that is just being created by copy_process(), and for\nwhich the sched_post_fork() has not been executed yet.
