        "summary": "Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. A security vulnerability in Envoy allows external clients to manipulate Envoy headers, potentially leading to unauthorized access or other malicious actions within the mesh. This issue arises due to Envoy's default configuration of internal trust boundaries, which considers all RFC1918 private address ranges as internal. The default behavior for handling internal addresses in Envoy has been changed. Previously, RFC1918 IP addresses were automatically considered internal, even if the internal_address_config was empty.  The default configuration of Envoy will continue to trust internal addresses while in this release and it will not trust them by default in next release. If you have tooling such as probes on your private network which need to be treated as trusted (e.g. changing arbitrary x-envoy headers) please explicitly include those addresses or CIDR ranges into `internal_address_config`. Successful exploitation could allow attackers to bypass security controls, access sensitive data, or disrupt services within the mesh, like Istio. This issue has been addressed in versions 1.31.2, 1.30.6, 1.29.9, and 1.28.7. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."

Versions prior to 3.0.0 have an issue in the Power Platform Terraform Provider where sensitive information, specifically the `client_secret` used in the service principal authentication, may be exposed in logs. This exposure occurs due to an error in the logging code that causes the `client_secret` to not be properly masked when logs are persisted or viewed. Users should upgrade to version 3.0.0 to receive a patched version of the provider that removes all logging of sensitive content. Users who have used this provider with the affected versions should take the following additional steps to mitigate the risk: Immediately rotate the `client_secret` for any service principal that has been configured using this Terraform provider. This will invalidate any potentially exposed secrets. Those who have set the `TF_LOG_PATH` environment variable or configured Terraform to persist logs to a file or an external system, consider disabling this until they have updated to a fixed version of the provider. Those who have existing logs that may contain the `client_secret` should remove or sanitize these logs to prevent unauthorized access. This includes logs on disk, in monitoring systems, or in logging services."
