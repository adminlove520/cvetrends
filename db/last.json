Prior to versions 8.0.4 and 1.7.8.9, the `ValidateCore::isCleanHTML()` method of Prestashop misses hijackable events which can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) injection, allowed by the presence of pre-setup `@keyframes` methods. This XSS, which hijacks HTML attributes, can be triggered without any interaction by the visitor/administrator, which makes it as dangerous as a trivial XSS attack. Contrary to other attacks which target HTML attributes and are triggered without user interaction (such as onload / onerror which suffer from a very limited scope), this one can hijack every HTML element, which increases the danger due to a complete HTML elements scope. Versions 8.0.4 and 1.7.8.9 contain a fix for this issue."

However, the protections for these two vulnerabilities previously did not work correctly together. As a result, if the site were configured to allow the upload of files with an htaccess extension, these files' filenames would not be properly sanitized. This could allow bypassing the protections provided by Drupal core's default .htaccess files and possible remote code execution on Apache web servers. This issue is mitigated by the fact that it requires a field administrator to explicitly configure a file field to allow htaccess as an extension (a restricted permission), or a contributed module or custom code that overrides allowed file uploads."

Using this plugin channel you are able to send a payload packet containing a byte (2) and a string (any spigot command). This could be used to make yourself a server operator and be used to extract other user information through phishing (pretending to be an admin), many servers use essentials so the /geoip command could be available to them, etc. This could also be modified to allow you to set the servers language, set another players language, etc. This issue affects those who have bungee enabled in config.

Prior to version 10.5.21, the `/admin/misc/script-proxy` API endpoint that is accessible by an authenticated administrator user is vulnerable to arbitrary JavaScript and CSS file read via the `scriptPath` and `scripts` parameters. The `scriptPath` parameter is not sanitized properly and is vulnerable to path traversal attack. Any JavaScript/CSS file from the application server can be read by specifying sufficient number of `../` patterns to go out from the application webroot followed by path of the folder where the file is located in the \"scriptPath\" parameter and the file name in the \"scripts\" parameter. The JavaScript file is successfully read only if the web application has read access to it. Users should update to version 10.5.21 to receive a patch or, as a workaround, apply the patch manual."
