An attacker could take advantage of this and provide a malicious link hosted on the subdomain to the user to gain access to the victim\u2019s account in certain scenarios. A possible victim would need to login through the malicious link for this exploit to work. If the possible victim already had the cookie present, the attack would not succeed. The attack would further only be possible if there was an initial vulnerability on the subdomain. This could either be the attacker being able to control DNS or a XSS vulnerability in an application hosted on a subdomain. Versions 2.46.0, 2.45.1, and 2.44.3 have been patched. Zitadel recommends upgrading to the latest versions available in due course. Note that applying the patch will invalidate the current cookie and thus users will need to start a new session and existing sessions (user selection) will be empty. For self-hosted environments unable to upgrade to a patched version, prevent setting the following cookie name on subdomains of your Zitadel instance (e.g. within your WAF): `__Secure-zitadel-useragent`."

In this mode, the\nIC doesn't increment the register address for each R/W byte.\n\nThe regmap_raw_read() and regmap_raw_write() are functions which can\nperform IO over multiple registers. They are currently used to read/write\nfrom/to the FIFO, and although they operate correctly in this burst mode on\nthe SPI bus, they would corrupt the regmap cache if it was not disabled\nmanually. The reason is that when the R/W size is more than 1 byte, these\nfunctions assume that the register address is incremented and handle the\ncache accordingly.\n\nConvert FIFO R/W functions to use the regmap _noinc_ versions in order to\nremove the manual cache control which was a workaround when using the\n_raw_ versions. FIFO registers are properly declared as volatile so\ncache will not be used/updated for FIFO accesses."

It discovers that\nthe refcount of this target page is 1, preventing the offline operation, thus\nproceeding to dump the page. However, page_mapping() of the target page may\nreturn an incorrect file mapping to crash the system in dump_mapping(), since\nthe target page->mapping only saves 'anon_vma' pointer without setting\nPAGE_MAPPING_ANON flag.\n\nThere are seveval ways to fix this issue:\n(1) Setting the PAGE_MAPPING_ANON flag for target page's ->mapping when saving\n'anon_vma', but this can confuse PageAnon() for PFN walkers, since the target\npage has not built mappings yet.\n(2) Getting the page lock to call page_mapping() in __dump_page() to avoid crashing\nthe system, however, there are still some PFN walkers that call page_mapping()\nwithout holding the page lock, such as compaction.\n(3) Using target page->private field to save the 'anon_vma' pointer and 2 bits\npage state, just as page->mapping records an anonymous page, which can remove\nthe page_mapping() impact for PFN walkers and also seems a simple way.\n\nSo I choose option 3 to fix this issue, and this can also fix other potential\nissues for PFN walkers, such as compaction."

Executing the argument function synchronously from within\ndpm_async_fn() may also be problematic for ordering reasons (it may\ncause a consumer device's resume callback to be invoked before a\nrequisite supplier device's one, for example).\n\nAddress this by changing the code in question to use\nasync_schedule_dev_nocall() for scheduling the asynchronous\nexecution of device suspend and resume functions and to directly\nrun them synchronously if async_schedule_dev_nocall() returns false."

        "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ns390/vfio-ap: always filter entire AP matrix\n\nThe vfio_ap_mdev_filter_matrix function is called whenever a new adapter or\ndomain is assigned to the mdev. The purpose of the function is to update\nthe guest's AP configuration by filtering the matrix of adapters and\ndomains assigned to the mdev. When an adapter or domain is assigned, only\nthe APQNs associated with the APID of the new adapter or APQI of the new\ndomain are inspected. If an APQN does not reference a queue device bound to\nthe vfio_ap device driver, then it's APID will be filtered from the mdev's\nmatrix when updating the guest's AP configuration.\n\nInspecting only the APID of the new adapter or APQI of the new domain will\nresult in passing AP queues through to a guest that are not bound to the\nvfio_ap device driver under certain circumstances. Consider the following:\n\nguest's AP configuration (all also assigned to the mdev's matrix):\n14.0004\n14.0005\n14.0006\n16.0004\n16.0005\n16.0006\n\nunassign domain 4\nunbind queue 16.0005\nassign domain 4\n\nWhen domain 4 is re-assigned, since only domain 4 will be inspected, the\nAPQNs that will be examined will be:\n14.0004\n16.0004\n\nSince both of those APQNs reference queue devices that are bound to the\nvfio_ap device driver, nothing will get filtered from the mdev's matrix\nwhen updating the guest's AP configuration. Consequently, queue 16.0005\nwill get passed through despite not being bound to the driver. This\nviolates the linux device model requirement that a guest shall only be\ngiven access to devices bound to the device driver facilitating their\npass-through.\n\nTo resolve this problem, every adapter and domain assigned to the mdev will\nbe inspected when filtering the mdev's matrix."
