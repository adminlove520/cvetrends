It is a complex issue.\n\nT1. the first flush is at the ending stage, it clears 'mddev->flush_bio'\n    and tries to submit data, but is blocked because mddev is suspended\n    by T4.\nT2. the second flush sets 'mddev->flush_bio', and attempts to queue\n    md_submit_flush_data(), which is already running (T1) and won't\n    execute again if on the same CPU as T1.\nT3. the third flush inc active_io and tries to flush, but is blocked because\n    'mddev->flush_bio' is not NULL (set by T2).\nT4. mddev_suspend() is called and waits for active_io dec to 0 which is inc\n    by T3.\n\n  T1\t\tT2\t\tT3\t\tT4\n  (flush 1)\t(flush 2)\t(third 3)\t(suspend)\n  md_submit_flush_data\n   mddev->flush_bio = NULL;\n   .\n   .\t \tmd_flush_request\n   .\t  \t mddev->flush_bio = bio\n   .\t  \t queue submit_flushes\n   .\t\t .\n   .\t\t .\t\tmd_handle_request\n   .\t\t .\t\t active_io + 1\n   .\t\t .\t\t md_flush_request\n   .\t\t .\t\t  wait !mddev->flush_bio\n   .\t\t .\n   .\t\t .\t\t\t\tmddev_suspend\n   .\t\t .\t\t\t\t wait !active_io\n   .\t\t .\n   .\t\t submit_flushes\n   .\t\t queue_work md_submit_flush_data\n   .\t\t //md_submit_flush_data is already running (T1)\n   .\n   md_handle_request\n    wait resume\n\nThe root issue is non-atomic inc/dec of active_io during flush process.\nactive_io is dec before md_submit_flush_data is queued, and inc soon\nafter md_submit_flush_data() run.\n  md_flush_request\n    active_io + 1\n    submit_flushes\n      active_io - 1\n      md_submit_flush_data\n        md_handle_request\n        active_io + 1\n          make_request\n        active_io - 1\n\nIf active_io is dec after md_handle_request() instead of within\nsubmit_flushes(), make_request() can be called directly intead of\nmd_handle_request() in md_submit_flush_data(), and active_io will\nonly inc and dec once in the whole flush process.

Since dm always splits data and flush operation into two\nseparate io, io size of flush submitted by dm always is 0, make_request()\nwill not be called in md_submit_flush_data(). To prevent future\nmodifications from introducing issues, add WARN_ON to ensure\nmake_request() no error is returned in this context."

To do so, it polls the\nconfig space of the first child device on the secondary bus.  If that\nchild device is concurrently removed, accesses to its struct pci_dev\ncause the kernel to oops.\n\nThat's because pci_bridge_wait_for_secondary_bus() neglects to hold a\nreference on the child device.  Before v6.3, the function was only\ncalled on resume from system sleep or on runtime resume.  Holding a\nreference wasn't necessary back then because the pciehp IRQ thread\ncould never run concurrently.  (On resume from system sleep, IRQs are\nnot enabled until after the resume_noirq phase.  And runtime resume is\nalways awaited before a PCI device is removed.)\n\nHowever starting with v6.3, pci_bridge_wait_for_secondary_bus() is also\ncalled on a DPC event.  Commit 53b54ad074de (\"PCI/DPC: Await readiness\nof secondary bus after reset\"), which introduced that, failed to\nappreciate that pci_bridge_wait_for_secondary_bus() now needs to hold a\nreference on the child device because dpc_handler() and pciehp may\nindeed run concurrently.  The commit was backported to v5.10+ stable\nkernels, so that's the oldest one affected.\n\nAdd the missing reference acquisition.\n\nAbridged stack trace:\n\n  BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: 00000000091400c0\n  CPU: 15 PID: 2464 Comm: irq/53-pcie-dpc 6.9.0\n  RIP: pci_bus_read_config_dword+0x17/0x50\n  pci_dev_wait()\n  pci_bridge_wait_for_secondary_bus()\n  dpc_reset_link()\n  pcie_do_recovery()\n  dpc_handler()"

Before\nthat, the type resolution of BPF_PROG_TYPE_EXT prog actually follows\nthe logic below:\n\n  prog->aux->dst_prog ? prog->aux->dst_prog->type : prog->type;\n\nIt implies that when EXT program is not yet attached to `dst_prog`,\nthe prog type should be EXT itself. This code worked fine in the past.\nSo just keep using it.\n\nFix this by returning `prog->type` for BPF_PROG_TYPE_EXT if `dst_prog`\nis not present in resolve_prog_type()."
