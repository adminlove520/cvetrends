An unauthenticated attacker could abuse improperly secured access to arbitrary files on the server (via /Electron/download directory traversal in conjunction with a path component that uses backslash characters), leading to cleartext credential disclosure. Afterwards, the authenticated attacker is able to upload a file that overwrites a 3CX service binary, leading to Remote Code Execution as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM on Windows installations. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2022-48482."

        "summary": "@fastify/csrf-protection is a plugin which helps protect Fastify servers against CSRF attacks. The CSRF protection enforced by the @fastify/csrf-protection library in combination with @fastify/cookie can be bypassed from network and same-site attackers under certain conditions. @fastify/csrf-protection supports an optional userInfo parameter that binds the CSRF token to the user. This parameter has been introduced to prevent cookie-tossing attacks as a fix for CVE-2021-29624. Whenever userInfo parameter is missing, or its value can be predicted for the target user account, network and same-site attackers can 1. fixate a _csrf cookie in the victim's browser, and 2. forge CSRF tokens that are valid for the victim's session. This allows attackers to bypass the CSRF protection mechanism. As a fix, @fastify/csrf-protection starting from version 6.3.0 (and v4.1.0) includes a server-defined secret hmacKey that cryptographically binds the CSRF token to the value of the _csrf cookie and the userInfo parameter, making tokens non-spoofable by attackers. This protection is effective as long as the userInfo parameter is unique for each user. This is patched in versions 6.3.0 and v4.1.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may use a random, non-predictable userInfo parameter for each user as a mitigation."

Using this plugin channel you are able to send a payload packet containing a byte (2) and a string (any spigot command). This could be used to make yourself a server operator and be used to extract other user information through phishing (pretending to be an admin), many servers use essentials so the /geoip command could be available to them, etc. This could also be modified to allow you to set the servers language, set another players language, etc. This issue affects those who have bungee enabled in config.

The \"restricted\" mode of the HTML cleaner in XWiki, introduced in version 4.2-milestone-1 and massively improved in version 14.6-rc-1, allowed the injection of arbitrary HTML code and thus cross-site scripting via invalid HTML comments. As a consequence, any code relying on this \"restricted\" mode for security is vulnerable to JavaScript injection (\"cross-site scripting\"/XSS). When a privileged user with programming rights visits such a comment in XWiki, the malicious JavaScript code is executed in the context of the user session. This allows server-side code execution with programming rights, impacting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the XWiki instance. This problem has been patched in XWiki 14.10, HTML comments are now removed in restricted mode and a check has been introduced that ensures that comments don't start with `>`. There are no known workarounds apart from upgrading to a version including the fix.\n"
