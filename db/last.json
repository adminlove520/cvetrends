Removing that locking from read_descriptors() exposed it to\nthe race.\n\nThe best way to fix the bug is to keep hub_port_init() from changing\nudev->descriptor once udev has been initialized and registered.\nDrivers expect the descriptors stored in the kernel to be immutable;\nwe should not undermine this expectation.  In fact, this change should\nhave been made long ago.\n\nSo now hub_port_init() will take an additional argument, specifying a\nbuffer in which to store the device descriptor it reads.  (If udev has\nnot yet been initialized, the buffer pointer will be NULL and then\nhub_port_init() will store the device descriptor in udev as before.)\nThis eliminates the data race responsible for the out-of-bounds read.\n\nThe changes to hub_port_init() appear more extensive than they really\nare, because of indentation changes resulting from an attempt to avoid\nwriting to other parts of the usb_device structure after it has been\ninitialized.  Similar changes should be made to the code that reads\nthe BOS descriptor, but that can be handled in a separate patch later\non.  This patch is sufficient to fix the bug found by syzbot."
