A p2c parameter set too high in JWE's algorithm PBES2-* could lead to a denial of service. The JWE key management algorithms based on PBKDF2 require a JOSE Header Parameter called p2c (PBES2 Count). This parameter dictates the number of PBKDF2 iterations needed to derive a CEK wrapping key. Its primary purpose is to intentionally slow down the key derivation function, making password brute-force and dictionary attacks more resource- intensive. Therefore, if an attacker sets the p2c parameter in JWE to a very large number, it can cause a lot of computational consumption, resulting in a denial of service. This vulnerability has been addressed in commit `64f2a229b` which has been included in release version 1.2.27 and 2.0.18. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."

The vulnerability is due to Cisco IOS Software application changes that create UDP sockets and leave the sockets idle without closing them. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending UDP packets with a destination port of 0 to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause UDP packets to be held in the input interfaces queue, resulting in a DoS condition. The input interface queue will stop holding UDP packets when it receives 250 packets. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCup10024, CSCva55744, CSCva95506."

NFSD has never sanity-\nchecked the READDIR count argument, but the old entry encoders\nmanaged the problem correctly.\n\nWith the commits below, entry encoding changed, exposing the\nunderflow to the pointer arithmetic in xdr_reserve_space().\n\nModern NFS clients attempt to retrieve as much data as possible\nfor each READDIR request. Also, we have no unit tests that\nexercise the behavior of READDIR at the lower bound of @count\nvalues. Thus this case was missed during testing."

Advancing the iterator\nresults in skipping the top-level SPTE and all its children, which is\nfatal if any of the skipped SPTEs were not visited before yielding.\n\nWhen zapping all SPTEs, i.e. when min_level == root_level, restarting the\niter and then invoking tdp_iter_next() is always fatal if the current gfn\nhas as a valid SPTE, as advancing the iterator results in try_step_side()\nskipping the current gfn, which wasn't visited before yielding.\n\nSprinkle WARNs on iter->yielded being true in various helpers that are\noften used in conjunction with yielding, and tag the helper with\n__must_check to reduce the probabily of improper usage.\n\nFailing to zap a top-level SPTE manifests in one of two ways.  If a valid\nSPTE is skipped by both kvm_tdp_mmu_zap_all() and kvm_tdp_mmu_put_root(),\nthe shadow page will be leaked and KVM will WARN accordingly.\n\n  WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 3509 at arch/x86/kvm/mmu/tdp_mmu.c:46 [kvm]\n  RIP: 0010:kvm_mmu_uninit_tdp_mmu+0x3e/0x50 [kvm]\n  Call Trace:\n   <TASK>\n   kvm_arch_destroy_vm+0x130/0x1b0 [kvm]\n   kvm_destroy_vm+0x162/0x2a0 [kvm]\n   kvm_vcpu_release+0x34/0x60 [kvm]\n   __fput+0x82/0x240\n   task_work_run+0x5c/0x90\n   do_exit+0x364/0xa10\n   ? futex_unqueue+0x38/0x60\n   do_group_exit+0x33/0xa0\n   get_signal+0x155/0x850\n   arch_do_signal_or_restart+0xed/0x750\n   exit_to_user_mode_prepare+0xc5/0x120\n   syscall_exit_to_user_mode+0x1d/0x40\n   do_syscall_64+0x48/0xc0\n   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae\n\nIf kvm_tdp_mmu_zap_all() skips a gfn/SPTE but that SPTE is then zapped by\nkvm_tdp_mmu_put_root(), KVM triggers a use-after-free in the form of\nmarking a struct page as dirty/accessed after it has been put back on the\nfree list.

The downside of that approach\nis that tdp_mmu_iter_cond_resched() _must_ be called before anything else\nin the loop, and there's no easy way to enfornce that requirement.\n\nIdeally, KVM would handling the cond_resched() fully within the iterator\nmacro (the code is actually quite clean) and avoid this entire class of\nbugs, but that is extremely difficult do wh\n---truncated---"
