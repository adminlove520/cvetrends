In 26.0.0, IPv6 is not disabled on network interfaces, including those belonging to networks where `--ipv6=false`. An container with an `ipvlan` or `macvlan` interface will normally be configured to share an external network link with the host machine. Because of this direct access, (1) Containers may be able to communicate with other hosts on the local network over link-local IPv6 addresses, (2) if router advertisements are being broadcast over the local network, containers may get SLAAC-assigned addresses, and (3) the interface  will be a member of IPv6 multicast groups. This means interfaces in IPv4-only networks present an unexpectedly and unnecessarily increased attack surface. The issue is patched in 26.0.2. To completely disable IPv6 in a container, use `--sysctl=net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1` in the `docker create` or `docker run` command. Or, in the service configuration of a `compose` file."

By using ANSI escape sequences and a race between `libc::tcflush(0, libc::TCIFLUSH)` and reading standard input, it's possible to manipulate the permission prompt and force it to allow an unsafe action regardless of the user input. Some ANSI escape sequences act as a info request to the master terminal emulator and the terminal emulator sends back the reply in the PTY channel. standard streams also use this channel to send and get data. For example the `\\033[6n` sequence requests the current cursor position. These sequences allow us to append data to the standard input of Deno. This vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass Deno permission policy.  This vulnerability is fixed in 1.42.2.\n"

Normally, the `--command` argument of `flatpak run` expects to be given a command to run in the specified Flatpak app, optionally along with some arguments. However it is possible to instead pass `bwrap` arguments to `--command=`, such as `--bind`. It's possible to pass an arbitrary `commandline` to the portal interface `org.freedesktop.portal.Background.RequestBackground` from within a Flatpak app. When this is converted into a `--command` and arguments, it achieves the same effect of passing arguments directly to `bwrap`, and thus can be used for a sandbox escape. The solution is to pass the `--` argument to `bwrap`, which makes it stop processing options. This has been supported since bubblewrap 0.3.0. All supported versions of Flatpak require at least that version of bubblewrap. xdg-desktop-portal version 1.18.4 will mitigate this vulnerability by only allowing Flatpak apps to create .desktop files for commands that do not start with --. The vulnerability is patched in 1.15.8, 1.10.9, 1.12.9, and 1.14.6."

        "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ninet: inet_defrag: prevent sk release while still in use\n\nip_local_out() and other functions can pass skb->sk as function argument.\n\nIf the skb is a fragment and reassembly happens before such function call\nreturns, the sk must not be released.\n\nThis affects skb fragments reassembled via netfilter or similar\nmodules, e.g. openvswitch or ct_act.c, when run as part of tx pipeline.\n\nEric Dumazet made an initial analysis of this bug.  Quoting Eric:\n  Calling ip_defrag() in output path is also implying skb_orphan(),\n  which is buggy because output path relies on sk not disappearing.\n\n  A relevant old patch about the issue was :\n  8282f27449bf (\"inet: frag: Always orphan skbs inside ip_defrag()\")\n\n  [..]\n\n  net/ipv4/ip_output.c depends on skb->sk being set, and probably to an\n  inet socket, not an arbitrary one.\n\n  If we orphan the packet in ipvlan, then downstream things like FQ\n  packet scheduler will not work properly.\n\n  We need to change ip_defrag() to only use skb_orphan() when really\n  needed, ie whenever frag_list is going to be used.\n\nEric suggested to stash sk in fragment queue and made an initial patch.\nHowever there is a problem with this:\n\nIf skb is refragmented again right after, ip_do_fragment() will copy\nhead->sk to the new fragments, and sets up destructor to sock_wfree.\nIOW, we have no choice but to fix up sk_wmem accouting to reflect the\nfully reassembled skb, else wmem will underflow.\n\nThis change moves the orphan down into the core, to last possible moment.\nAs ip_defrag_offset is aliased with sk_buff->sk member, we must move the\noffset into the FRAG_CB, else skb->sk gets clobbered.\n\nThis allows to delay the orphaning long enough to learn if the skb has\nto be queued or if the skb is completing the reasm queue.\n\nIn the former case, things work as before, skb is orphaned.  This is\nsafe because skb gets queued/stolen and won't continue past reasm engine.\n\nIn the latter case, we will steal the skb->sk reference, reattach it to\nthe head skb, and fix up wmem accouting when inet_frag inflates truesize."
