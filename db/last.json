This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users visiting pages that use this template engine. This can lead to various consequences, including session hijacking, defacement of web pages, theft of sensitive information, or even the propagation of malware.\n\nVersion 1.0.1 contains a patch for this issue. To mitigate this vulnerability, the template engine should properly escape special characters, including single quotes. Common practice is to escape `'` as `&#39`. As a workaround, users can avoid this issue by using only double quotes `\"` for HTML attributes."

A path traversal vulnerability exists in the Xibo CMS whereby a specially crafted zip file can be uploaded to the CMS via the layout import function by an authenticated user which would allow creation of files outside of the CMS library directory as the webserver user. This can be used to upload a PHP webshell inside the web root directory and achieve remote code execution as the webserver user. Users should upgrade to version 2.3.17 or 3.3.5, which fix this issue. Customers who host their CMS with Xibo Signage have already received an upgrade or patch to resolve this issue regardless of the CMS version that they are running."

An SQL injection vulnerability was discovered in the `/dataset/data/{id}` API route inside the CMS starting in version 1.4.0 and prior to versions 2.3.17 and 3.3.5. This allows an authenticated user to exfiltrate data from the Xibo database by injecting specially crafted values in to the `filter` parameter. Values allowed in the filter parameter are checked against a deny list of commands that should not be allowed, however this checking was done in a case sensitive manor and so it is possible to bypass these checks by using unusual case combinations.

Version 2.9.1 and prior are vulnerable to denial of service. ?The `checkUserPassword` method is used to check whether the password provided by the user matches the password saved in the database, and the `CodingUtil.md5` method is used to encrypt the original password with MD5 to ensure that the password will not be saved in plain text when it is stored. If a user submits a very long password when logging in, the system will be forced to execute the long password MD5 encryption process, causing the server CPU and memory to be exhausted, thereby causing a denial of service attack on the server. This issue is fixed in version 2.10.0-lts with a maximum password length."
