An attacker could lead a user to a malicious page that submits a form POST that contains  embedded JavaScript code. This code would then be included in the response, along with an attacker-controlled `Content-Type` header, and so potentially executed in the victim's browser as if it was part of OpenRefine. The attacker-provided code can do anything the user can do, including deleting projects, retrieving database passwords, or executing arbitrary Jython or Closure expressions, if those extensions are also present. The attacker must know a valid project ID of a project that contains at least one row. Version 3.8.3 fixes the issue."

To\navert any risk of bit overflow, we add an extra sanity check for this in\nthat function.

Meanwhile, the waker was passing the clobbered garbage in\ndata->task to wake_up_process(), leading to the crash.\n\nWhat's happening is that in between rq_qos_wake_function() deleting the\nwaitqueue entry and calling wake_up_process(), rq_qos_wait() is finding\nthat it already got a token and returning.

Note that autoremove_wake_function() wakes the waiter\nand THEN deletes the waitqueue entry, which is the proper order.\n\nFix it by swapping the order. We also need to use\nlist_del_init_careful() to match the list_empty_careful() in\nfinish_wait()."
