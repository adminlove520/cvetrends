In affected versions the default configuration does not check authorization of the signer, it only checks the validity of the signature per section 3.2.2 of the w3 xmldsig-core-20080610 spec. As such, without additional validation steps, the default configuration allows a malicious actor to re-sign an XML document, place the certificate in a `<KeyInfo />` element, and pass `xml-crypto` default validation checks. As a result `xml-crypto` trusts by default any certificate provided via digitally signed XML document's `<KeyInfo />`. `xml-crypto` prefers to use any certificate provided via digitally signed XML document's `<KeyInfo />` even if library was configured to use specific certificate (`publicCert`) for signature verification purposes.  An attacker can spoof signature verification by modifying XML document and replacing existing signature with signature generated with malicious private key (created by attacker) and by attaching that private key's certificate to `<KeyInfo />` element. This vulnerability is combination of changes introduced to `4.0.0` on pull request 301 / commit `c2b83f98` and has been addressed in version 6.0.0 with pull request 445 / commit `21201723d`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may either check the certificate extracted via `getCertFromKeyInfo` against trusted certificates before accepting the results of the validation or set `xml-crypto's getCertFromKeyInfo` to `() => undefined` forcing `xml-crypto` to use an explicitly configured `publicCert` or `privateKey` for signature verification."

This vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin, or by a user who has not been granted edit access to the model in question. The editing interfaces for pages and snippets are also unaffected. Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 6.0.3 and 6.1. Wagtail releases prior to 6.0 are unaffected. Users are advised to upgrade. Site owners who are unable to upgrade to a patched version can avoid the vulnerability as follows: 1.For models registered through `ModelViewSet`, register the model as a snippet instead; 2. For settings models, place the restricted fields in a separate settings model, and configure permission at the model level."

The affected versions of Apollo Router contain a bug that in limited circumstances, could lead to unexpected operations being executed which can result in unintended data or effects. This only affects Router instances configured to use distributed query plan caching. The root cause of this defect is a bug in Apollo Router\u2019s cache retrieval logic: When this defect is present and distributed query planning caching is enabled, asking the Router to execute an operation (whether it is a query, a mutation, or a subscription) may result in an unexpected variation of that operation being executed or the generation of unexpected errors. The issue stems from inadvertently executing a modified version of a previously executed operation, whose query plan is stored in the underlying cache (specifically, Redis). Depending on the type of the operation, the result may vary. For a query, results may be fetched that don\u2019t match what was requested (e.g., rather than running `fetchUsers(type: ENTERPRISE)` the Router may run `fetchUsers(type: TRIAL)`. For a mutation, this may result in incorrect mutations being sent to underlying subgraph servers (e.g., rather than sending `deleteUser(id: 10)` to a subgraph, the Router may run `deleteUser(id: 12)`. Users who are using distributed query plan caching, are advised to either upgrade to version 1.45.1 or above or downgrade to version 1.43.2 of the Apollo Router. Apollo Router versions 1.44.0 or 1.45.0 are not recommended for use and have been withdrawn. Users unable to upgrade can disable distributed query plan caching to mitigate this issue."

This is not safe though since after taking xa_lock,\nanother page in the mapping could be processed for writeback inside\nan interrupt, and deadlock can occur.  The fix is simple and clean\nif we use xa_for_each_range(), which handles the iteration with RCU\nwhile reducing code complexity.\n\nThe problem is easily reproduced with the following test:\n mount -o vers=3,fsc 127.0.0.1:/export /mnt/nfs\n dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/nfs/file1.bin bs=4096 count=1\n echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\n dd if=/mnt/nfs/file1.bin of=/dev/null\n umount /mnt/nfs\n\nOn the console with a lockdep-enabled kernel a message similar to\nthe following will be seen:\n\n ================================\n WARNING: inconsistent lock state\n 6.7.0-lockdbg+ #10 Not tainted\n --------------------------------\n inconsistent {IN-SOFTIRQ-W} -> {SOFTIRQ-ON-W} usage.\n test5/1708 [HC0[0]:SC0[0]:HE1:SE1] takes:\n ffff888127baa598 (&xa->xa_lock#4){+.?.}-{3:3}, at:\nnfs_netfs_issue_read+0x1b2/0x4b0 [nfs]\n {IN-SOFTIRQ-W} state was registered at:\n   lock_acquire+0x144/0x380\n   _raw_spin_lock_irqsave+0x4e/0xa0\n   __folio_end_writeback+0x17e/0x5c0\n   folio_end_writeback+0x93/0x1b0\n   iomap_finish_ioend+0xeb/0x6a0\n   blk_update_request+0x204/0x7f0\n   blk_mq_end_request+0x30/0x1c0\n   blk_complete_reqs+0x7e/0xa0\n   __do_softirq+0x113/0x544\n   __irq_exit_rcu+0xfe/0x120\n   irq_exit_rcu+0xe/0x20\n   sysvec_call_function_single+0x6f/0x90\n   asm_sysvec_call_function_single+0x1a/0x20\n   pv_native_safe_halt+0xf/0x20\n   default_idle+0x9/0x20\n   default_idle_call+0x67/0xa0\n   do_idle+0x2b5/0x300\n   cpu_startup_entry+0x34/0x40\n   start_secondary+0x19d/0x1c0\n   secondary_startup_64_no_verify+0x18f/0x19b\n irq event stamp: 176891\n hardirqs last  enabled at (176891): [<ffffffffa67a0be4>]\n_raw_spin_unlock_irqrestore+0x44/0x60\n hardirqs last disabled at (176890): [<ffffffffa67a0899>]\n_raw_spin_lock_irqsave+0x79/0xa0\n softirqs last  enabled at (176646): [<ffffffffa515d91e>]\n__irq_exit_rcu+0xfe/0x120\n softirqs last disabled at (176633): [<ffffffffa515d91e>]\n__irq_exit_rcu+0xfe/0x120\n\n other info that might help us debug this:\n  Possible unsafe locking scenario:\n\n        CPU0\n        ----\n   lock(&xa->xa_lock#4);\n   <Interrupt>\n     lock(&xa->xa_lock#4);\n\n  *** DEADLOCK ***\n\n 2 locks held by test5/1708:\n  #0: ffff888127baa498 (&sb->s_type->i_mutex_key#22){++++}-{4:4}, at:\n      nfs_start_io_read+0x28/0x90 [nfs]\n  #1: ffff888127baa650 (mapping.invalidate_lock#3){.+.+}-{4:4}, at:\n      page_cache_ra_unbounded+0xa4/0x280\n\n stack backtrace:\n CPU: 6 PID: 1708 Comm: test5 Kdump: loaded Not tainted 6.7.0-lockdbg+\n Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS 1.16.3-1.fc39\n04/01/2014\n Call Trace:\n  dump_stack_lvl+0x5b/0x90\n  mark_lock+0xb3f/0xd20\n  __lock_acquire+0x77b/0x3360\n  _raw_spin_lock+0x34/0x80\n  nfs_netfs_issue_read+0x1b2/0x4b0 [nfs]\n  netfs_begin_read+0x77f/0x980 [netfs]\n  nfs_netfs_readahead+0x45/0x60 [nfs]\n  nfs_readahead+0x323/0x5a0 [nfs]\n  read_pages+0xf3/0x5c0\n  page_cache_ra_unbounded+0x1c8/0x280\n  filemap_get_pages+0x38c/0xae0\n  filemap_read+0x206/0x5e0\n  nfs_file_read+0xb7/0x140 [nfs]\n  vfs_read+0x2a9/0x460\n  ksys_read+0xb7/0x140"
