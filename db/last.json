The format for the PAX extended headers carrying this data consists of two numbers separated by a period [2], indicating seconds and subsecond precision (for example \u201c1647221103.5998539\u201d). The impacted fields are \u201catime\u201d, \u201cctime\u201d, \u201cmtime\u201d and \u201cLIBARCHIVE.creationtime\u201d. No input validation is performed prior to the parsing of header values.\n\nParsing of these numbers uses the BigDecimal [3] class from the JDK which has a publicly known algorithmic complexity issue when doing operations on large numbers, causing denial of service (see issue # JDK-6560193 [4]). A third party can manipulate file time headers in a TAR file by placing a number with a very long fraction (300,000 digits) or a number with exponent notation (such as \u201c9e9999999\u201d) within a file modification time header, and the parsing of files with these headers will take hours instead of seconds, leading to a denial of service via exhaustion of CPU resources. This issue is similar to CVE-2012-2098 [5].\n\n[1]:  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COMPRESS-612 \n[2]:  https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/pax.html#tag_20_92_13_05 \n[3]:  https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/math/BigDecimal.html \n[4]:  https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-6560193 \n[5]:  https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-2098 \n\nOnly applications using CompressorStreamFactory class (with auto-detection of file types), TarArchiveInputStream and TarFile classes to parse TAR files are impacted. Since this code was introduced in v1.22, only that version and later versions are impacted.\n\n"
