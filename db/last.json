The issue is in the nft_byteorder_eval() function, where the code iterates through a loop and writes to the `dst` array. On each iteration, 8 bytes are written, but `dst` is an array of u32, so each element only has space for 4 bytes. That means every iteration overwrites part of the previous element corrupting this array of u32. This flaw allows a local user to cause a denial of service or potentially break NetFilter functionality."

This can potentially cause sensitive information to leak upon an HTTP redirect to a different domain., e.g. should `https://example.com` redirect to `http://cloudstorageprovider.com` the latter will receive the cookie `session`. Treq 2021.1.0 and later bind cookies given to request methods (`treq.request`, `treq.get`, `HTTPClient.request`, `HTTPClient.get`, etc.) to the origin of the *url* parameter.

It is the view of the blockchain development team that the threat posed by a hypothetical binary planting attack is minimal and represents a low-security risk. The vulnerable DLL files are from the Windows networking subsystem, the Visual C++ runtime, and low-level cryptographic primitives. Collectively these dependencies are required for a large ecosystem of applications, ranging from enterprise-level security applications to game engines, and don\u2019t represent a fundamental lack of security or oversight in the design and implementation of Creditcoin. The blockchain team takes the stance that running Creditcoin on Windows is officially unsupported and at best should be thought of as experimental."
