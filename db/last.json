        "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\naio: fix use-after-free due to missing POLLFREE handling\n\nsignalfd_poll() and binder_poll() are special in that they use a\nwaitqueue whose lifetime is the current task, rather than the struct\nfile as is normally the case.  This is okay for blocking polls, since a\nblocking poll occurs within one task; however, non-blocking polls\nrequire another solution.  This solution is for the queue to be cleared\nbefore it is freed, by sending a POLLFREE notification to all waiters.\n\nUnfortunately, only eventpoll handles POLLFREE.  A second type of\nnon-blocking poll, aio poll, was added in kernel v4.18, and it doesn't\nhandle POLLFREE.  This allows a use-after-free to occur if a signalfd or\nbinder fd is polled with aio poll, and the waitqueue gets freed.\n\nFix this by making aio poll handle POLLFREE.\n\nA patch by Ramji Jiyani <ramjiyani@google.com>\n(https://lore.kernel.org/r/20211027011834.2497484-1-ramjiyani@google.com)\ntried to do this by making aio_poll_wake() always complete the request\ninline if POLLFREE is seen.  However, that solution had two bugs.\nFirst, it introduced a deadlock, as it unconditionally locked the aio\ncontext while holding the waitqueue lock, which inverts the normal\nlocking order.  Second, it didn't consider that POLLFREE notifications\nare missed while the request has been temporarily de-queued.\n\nThe second problem was solved by my previous patch.  This patch then\nproperly fixes the use-after-free by handling POLLFREE in a\ndeadlock-free way.  It does this by taking advantage of the fact that\nfreeing of the waitqueue is RCU-delayed, similar to what eventpoll does."

        "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/msm: Fix mmap to include VM_IO and VM_DONTDUMP\n\nIn commit 510410bfc034 (\"drm/msm: Implement mmap as GEM object\nfunction\") we switched to a new/cleaner method of doing things. That's\ngood, but we missed a little bit.\n\nBefore that commit, we used to _first_ run through the\ndrm_gem_mmap_obj() case where `obj->funcs->mmap()` was NULL. That meant\nthat we ran:\n\n  vma->vm_flags |= VM_IO | VM_PFNMAP | VM_DONTEXPAND | VM_DONTDUMP;\n  vma->vm_page_prot = pgprot_writecombine(vm_get_page_prot(vma->vm_flags));\n  vma->vm_page_prot = pgprot_decrypted(vma->vm_page_prot);\n\n...and _then_ we modified those mappings with our own. Now that\n`obj->funcs->mmap()` is no longer NULL we don't run the default\ncode. It looks like the fact that the vm_flags got VM_IO / VM_DONTDUMP\nwas important because we're now getting crashes on Chromebooks that\nuse ARC++ while logging out. Specifically a crash that looks like this\n(this is on a 5.10 kernel w/ relevant backports but also seen on a\n5.15 kernel):\n\n  Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address ffffffc008000000\n  Mem abort info:\n    ESR = 0x96000006\n    EC = 0x25: DABT (current EL), IL = 32 bits\n    SET = 0, FnV = 0\n    EA = 0, S1PTW = 0\n  Data abort info:\n    ISV = 0, ISS = 0x00000006\n    CM = 0, WnR = 0\n  swapper pgtable: 4k pages, 39-bit VAs, pgdp=000000008293d000\n  [ffffffc008000000] pgd=00000001002b3003, p4d=00000001002b3003,\n                     pud=00000001002b3003, pmd=0000000000000000\n  Internal error: Oops: 96000006 [#1] PREEMPT SMP\n  [...]\n  CPU: 7 PID: 15734 Comm: crash_dump64 Tainted: G W 5.10.67 #1 [...]\n  Hardware name: Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. sc7280 IDP SKU2 platform (DT)\n  pstate: 80400009 (Nzcv daif +PAN -UAO -TCO BTYPE=--)\n  pc : __arch_copy_to_user+0xc0/0x30c\n  lr : copyout+0xac/0x14c\n  [...]\n  Call trace:\n   __arch_copy_to_user+0xc0/0x30c\n   copy_page_to_iter+0x1a0/0x294\n   process_vm_rw_core+0x240/0x408\n   process_vm_rw+0x110/0x16c\n   __arm64_sys_process_vm_readv+0x30/0x3c\n   el0_svc_common+0xf8/0x250\n   do_el0_svc+0x30/0x80\n   el0_svc+0x10/0x1c\n   el0_sync_handler+0x78/0x108\n   el0_sync+0x184/0x1c0\n  Code: f8408423 f80008c3 910020c6 36100082 (b8404423)\n\nLet's add the two flags back in.\n\nWhile we're at it, the fact that we aren't running the default means\nthat we _don't_ need to clear out VM_PFNMAP, so remove that and save\nan instruction.\n\nNOTE: it was confirmed that VM_IO was the important flag to fix the\nproblem I was seeing, but adding back VM_DONTDUMP seems like a sane\nthing to do so I'm doing that too."
