Only users with the following DHIS2 user role authorities can exploit this vulnerability. Note that in many systems the only users with user admin privileges are also superusers. In these cases, the escalation vulnerability does not exist. The vulnerability is only exploitable by attackers who can authenticate as users with the user admin authority. As this is usually a small and relatively trusted set of users, exploit vectors will often be limited.

        "summary": "go-merkledag implements the 'DAGService' interface and adds two ipld node types, Protobuf and Raw for the ipfs project. A `ProtoNode` may be modified in such a way as to cause various encode errors which will trigger a panic on common method calls that don't allow for error returns. A `ProtoNode` should only be able to encode to valid DAG-PB, attempting to encode invalid DAG-PB forms will result in an error from the codec. Manipulation of an existing (newly created or decoded) `ProtoNode` using the modifier methods did not account for certain states that would place the `ProtoNode` into an unencodeable form. Due to conformance with the [`github.com/ipfs/go-block-format#Block`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ipfs/go-block-format#Block) and [`github.com/ipfs/go-ipld-format#Node`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ipfs/go-ipld-format#Node) interfaces, certain methods, which internally require a re-encode if state has changed, will panic due to the inability to return an error. This issue has been addressed across a number of pull requests. Users are advised to upgrade to version 0.8.1 for a complete set of fixes. Users unable to upgrade may attempt to mitigate this issue by sanitising inputs when allowing user-input to set a new `CidBuilder` on a `ProtoNode` and by sanitising `Tsize` (`Link#Size`) values such that they are a reasonable byte-size for sub-DAGs where derived from user-input."

        "summary": "Passeo is an open source python password generator. Versions prior to 1.0.5 rely on the python `random` library for random value selection. The python `random` library warns that it should not be used for security purposes due to its reliance on a non-cryptographically secure random number generator. As a result a motivated attacker may be able to guess generated passwords. This issue has been addressed in version 1.0.5. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
