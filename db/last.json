The vulnerability only affects the handling of content types by Strapi, not the actual content types themselves. Users can use plugins or modify their own content types without realizing that the `privateAttributes` getter is being removed, which can result in any attribute becoming public. This can lead to sensitive information being exposed or the entire system being taken control of by an attacker(having access to password hashes). Anyone can be impacted, depending on how people are using/extending content-types. If the users are mutating the content-type, they will not be affected.

Note that earlier stable branches (1.0.x .. 2.18.x) have been EOLd already and do not receive updates anymore.\n\nIn general, RMI support can expose vulnerabilities by the mere presence of an exploitable class on the classpath. Even if Jackrabbit itself does not contain any code known to be exploitable anymore, adding other components to your server can expose the same type of problem. We therefore recommend to disable RMI access altogether (see further below), and will discuss deprecating RMI support in future Jackrabbit releases.\n\nHow to check whether RMI support is enabledRMI support can be over an RMI-specific TCP port, and over an HTTP binding. Both are by default enabled in Jackrabbit webapp/standalone.\n\nThe native RMI protocol by default uses port 1099. To check whether it is enabled, tools like \"netstat\" can be used to check.\n\nRMI-over-HTTP in Jackrabbit by default uses the path \"/rmi\". So when running standalone on port 8080, check whether an HTTP GET request on localhost:8080/rmi returns 404 (not enabled) or 200 (enabled). Note that the HTTP path may be different when the webapp is deployed in a container as non-root context, in which case the prefix is under the user's control.\n\nTurning off RMIFind web.xml (either in JAR/WAR file or in unpacked web application folder), and remove the declaration and the mapping definition for the RemoteBindingServlet:\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <servlet>\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <servlet-name>RMI</servlet-name>\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <servlet-class>org.apache.jackrabbit.servlet.remote.RemoteBindingServlet</servlet-class>\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 </servlet>\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <servlet-mapping>\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <servlet-name>RMI</servlet-name>\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <url-pattern>/rmi</url-pattern>\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 </servlet-mapping>\n\nFind the bootstrap.properties file (in $REPOSITORY_HOME), and set\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  rmi.enabled=false\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 and also remove\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  rmi.host\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  rmi.port\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  rmi.url-pattern\n\n\u00a0If there is no file named bootstrap.properties in $REPOSITORY_HOME, it is located somewhere in the classpath.

IDN hostnames are converted to puny code before used for certificate checks. Puny coded names always start with `xn--` and should not be allowed to pattern match, but the wildcard check in curl could still check for `x*`, which would match even though the IDN name most likely contained nothing even resembling an `x`."

We are currently unaware of any such applications.\n\nThe AES-SIV algorithm allows for authentication of multiple associated\ndata entries along with the encryption. To authenticate empty data the\napplication has to call EVP_EncryptUpdate() (or EVP_CipherUpdate()) with\nNULL pointer as the output buffer and 0 as the input buffer length.\nThe AES-SIV implementation in OpenSSL just returns success for such a call\ninstead of performing the associated data authentication operation.\nThe empty data thus will not be authenticated.\n\nAs this issue does not affect non-empty associated data authentication and\nwe expect it to be rare for an application to use empty associated data\nentries this is qualified as Low severity issue."
