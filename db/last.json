This causes page cache operations to\nhang waiting for the writeback flag.  For example,\ntruncate_inode_pages_final(), which is called via nilfs_evict_inode() when\nan inode is evicted from memory, will hang.\n\nSecond, the NILFS_I_COLLECTED flag set on normal inodes remain uncleared. \nAs a result, if the next log write involves checkpoint creation, that's\nfine, but if a partial log write is performed that does not, inodes with\nNILFS_I_COLLECTED set are erroneously removed from the \"sc_dirty_files\"\nlist, and their data and b-tree blocks may not be written to the device,\ncorrupting the block mapping.\n\nFix these issues by uniformly calling nilfs_segctor_abort_construction()\non failure of each step in the loop in nilfs_segctor_do_construct(),\nhaving it clean up logs and segment usages according to progress, and\ncorrecting the conditions for calling nilfs_redirty_inodes() to ensure\nthat the NILFS_I_COLLECTED flag is cleared."

The library uses `deepdiff.Delta` objects to modify application state based on frontend actions. However, it is possible to bypass the intended restrictions on modifying dunder attributes, allowing an attacker to construct a serialized delta that passes the deserializer whitelist and contains dunder attributes. When processed, this can be exploited to access other modules, classes, and instances, leading to arbitrary attribute write and total RCE on any self-hosted pytorch-lightning application in its default configuration, as the delta endpoint is enabled by default."

In the latter case, error unwinding calls the exit handlers\nin reverse order for the 'failed' netns.\n\ntcp_sk_exit_batch() calls tcp_twsk_purge().\nProblem is that since commit b099ce2602d8 (\"net: Batch inet_twsk_purge\"),\nthis function picks up twsk in any dying netns, not just the one passed\nin via exit_batch list.\n\nThis means that the error unwind of setup_net() can \"steal\" and destroy\ntimewait sockets belonging to the exiting netns.\n\nThis allows the netns exit worker to proceed to call\n\nWARN_ON_ONCE(!refcount_dec_and_test(&net->ipv4.tcp_death_row.tw_refcount));\n\nwithout the expected 1 -> 0 transition, which then splats.\n\nAt same time, error unwind path that is also running inet_twsk_purge()\nwill splat as well:\n\nWARNING: .. at lib/refcount.c:31 refcount_warn_saturate+0x1ed/0x210\n...\n refcount_dec include/linux/refcount.h:351 [inline]\n inet_twsk_kill+0x758/0x9c0 net/ipv4/inet_timewait_sock.c:70\n inet_twsk_deschedule_put net/ipv4/inet_timewait_sock.c:221\n inet_twsk_purge+0x725/0x890 net/ipv4/inet_timewait_sock.c:304\n tcp_sk_exit_batch+0x1c/0x170 net/ipv4/tcp_ipv4.c:3522\n ops_exit_list+0x128/0x180 net/core/net_namespace.c:178\n setup_net+0x714/0xb40 net/core/net_namespace.c:375\n copy_net_ns+0x2f0/0x670 net/core/net_namespace.c:508\n create_new_namespaces+0x3ea/0xb10 kernel/nsproxy.c:110\n\n... because refcount_dec() of tw_refcount unexpectedly dropped to 0.\n\nThis doesn't seem like an actual bug (no tw sockets got lost and I don't\nsee a use-after-free) but as erroneous trigger of debug check.\n\nAdd a mutex to force strict ordering: the task that calls tcp_twsk_purge()\nblocks other task from doing final _dec_and_test before mutex-owner has\nremoved all tw sockets of dying netns."

It was found out that different functionality is vulnerable to OS command injection attacks, for example for generating new X.509 certificates, or setting the time zone. These OS command injection vulnerabilities in the script generatesslreq.pml can be exploited as a low-privileged authenticated user to execute commands in the context of the Linux user www-data via shell metacharacters in HTTP POST data (e.g., the city parameter). The OS command injection vulnerability in the script settimezone.pml or setdatetime.pml (e.g., via the year parameter) requires an administrative user for the C-MOR web interface. By also exploiting a privilege-escalation vulnerability, it is possible to execute commands on the C-MOR system with root privileges."

In other words, the Tx buffer data on channel B is corrupted\nwith data from channel A.\n\nThe problem appeared since commit 4409df5866b7 (\"serial: sc16is7xx: change\nEFR lock to operate on each channels\"), which changed the EFR locking to\noperate on each channel instead of chip-wise.\n\nThis commit has introduced a regression, because the EFR lock is used not\nonly to protect the EFR registers access, but also, in a very obscure and\nundocumented way, to protect access to the data buffer, which is shared by\nthe Tx and Rx handlers, but also by each channel of the IC.\n\nFix this regression first by switching to kfifo_out_linear_ptr() in\nsc16is7xx_handle_tx() to eliminate the need for a shared Rx/Tx buffer.\n\nSecondly, replace the chip-wise Rx buffer with a separate Rx buffer for\neach channel."

        "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsmack: tcp: ipv4, fix incorrect labeling\n\nCurrently, Smack mirrors the label of incoming tcp/ipv4 connections:\nwhen a label 'foo' connects to a label 'bar' with tcp/ipv4,\n'foo' always gets 'foo' in returned ipv4 packets. So,\n1) returned packets are incorrectly labeled ('foo' instead of 'bar')\n2) 'bar' can write to 'foo' without being authorized to write.\n\nHere is a scenario how to see this:\n\n* Take two machines, let's call them C and S,\n   with active Smack in the default state\n   (no settings, no rules, no labeled hosts, only builtin labels)\n\n* At S, add Smack rule 'foo bar w'\n   (labels 'foo' and 'bar' are instantiated at S at this moment)\n\n* At S, at label 'bar', launch a program\n   that listens for incoming tcp/ipv4 connections\n\n* From C, at label 'foo', connect to the listener at S.\n   (label 'foo' is instantiated at C at this moment)\n   Connection succeedes and works.\n\n* Send some data in both directions.\n* Collect network traffic of this connection.\n\nAll packets in both directions are labeled with the CIPSO\nof the label 'foo'. Hence, label 'bar' writes to 'foo' without\nbeing authorized, and even without ever being known at C.\n\nIf anybody cares: exactly the same happens with DCCP.\n\nThis behavior 1st manifested in release 2.6.29.4 (see Fixes below)\nand it looks unintentional. At least, no explanation was provided.\n\nI changed returned packes label into the 'bar',\nto bring it into line with the Smack documentation claims."
