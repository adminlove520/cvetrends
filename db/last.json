Before\nthat, the type resolution of BPF_PROG_TYPE_EXT prog actually follows\nthe logic below:\n\n  prog->aux->dst_prog ? prog->aux->dst_prog->type : prog->type;\n\nIt implies that when EXT program is not yet attached to `dst_prog`,\nthe prog type should be EXT itself. This code worked fine in the past.\nSo just keep using it.\n\nFix this by returning `prog->type` for BPF_PROG_TYPE_EXT if `dst_prog`\nis not present in resolve_prog_type()."
