And the original endio function called bio_put() to free the whole\nbio.\n\nThis means a double freeing thus causing use-after-free, e.g.:\n\n1. Enter btrfs_submit_bio() with a read bio\n   The read bio length is 128K, crossing two 64K stripes.\n\n2. The first run of btrfs_submit_chunk()\n\n2.1 Call btrfs_map_block(), which returns 64K\n2.2 Call btrfs_split_bio()\n    Now there are two bios, one referring to the first 64K, the other\n    referring to the second 64K.\n2.3 The first half is submitted.\n\n3. The second run of btrfs_submit_chunk()\n\n3.1 Call btrfs_map_block(), which by somehow failed\n    Now we call btrfs_bio_end_io() to handle the error\n\n3.2 btrfs_bio_end_io() calls the original endio function\n    Which is end_bbio_data_read(), and it calls bio_put() for the\n    original bio.\n\n    Now the original bio is freed.\n\n4. The submitted first 64K bio finished\n   Now we call into btrfs_check_read_bio() and tries to advance the bio\n   iter.\n   But since the original bio (thus its iter) is already freed, we\n   trigger the above use-after free.\n\n   And even if the memory is not poisoned/corrupted, we will later call\n   the original endio function, causing a double freeing.\n\n[FIX]\nInstead of calling btrfs_bio_end_io(), call btrfs_orig_bbio_end_io(),\nwhich has the extra check on split bios and do the pr\n---truncated---"

As a result, the shared organization key is not rotated when a member departs. Consequently, the departing member, whose access should be revoked, retains a copy of the organization key. Additionally, the application fails to adequately protect some encrypted data stored on the server. Consequently, an authenticated user could gain unauthorized access to encrypted data of any organization, even if the user is not a member of the targeted organization. However, the user would need to know the corresponding organizationId. Hence, if a user (whose access to an organization has been revoked) already possesses the organization key, that user could use the key to decrypt the leaked data."
