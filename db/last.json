However, it could be recognized that certain embedded images (see PoC) are loaded, even though the \"Automatic Reloading of Images\" function is disabled by default. The reloading is also done unencrypted via HTTP and redirections are followed. This behavior is unexpected for the user, since the user assumes that external content will only be loaded after explicit manual confirmation. The loading of external content in e-mails represents a risk, because this makes the sender aware that the e-mail address is used, when the e-mail was read, which device is used and expose the user's IP address.

In versions 4.0.0 prior to 4.3.7 and 5.0.0 prior to 5.1.3, `canView` permission checks are bypassed for ORM data in paginated GraphQL query results where the total number of records is greater than the number of records per page. Note that this also affects GraphQL queries which have a limit applied, even if the query isn\u2019t paginated per se. This has been fixed in versions 4.3.7 and 5.1.3 by ensuring no new records are pulled in from the database after performing `canView` permission checks for each page of results. This may result in some pages in the query results having less than the maximum number of records per page even when there are more pages of results. This behavior is consistent with how pagination works in other areas of Silverstripe CMS, such as in `GridField`, and is a result of having to perform permission checks in PHP rather than in the database directly. One may disable these permission checks by disabling the `CanViewPermission` plugin."

In versions on the 1.x branch prior to 1.13.19 and on the 2.x branch prior to 2.1.8, users who don't have edit or delete permissions for records exposed in a `ModelAdmin` can still edit or delete records using the CSV import form, provided they have create permissions. The likelihood of a user having create permissions but not having edit or delete permissions is low, but it is possible. Note that this doesn't affect any `ModelAdmin` which has had the import form disabled via the `showImportForm` public property. Versions 1.13.19 and 2.1.8 contain a patch for the issue. Those who have a custom implementation of `BulkLoader` should update their implementations to respect permissions when the return value of `getCheckPermissions()` is true. Those who use any `BulkLoader` in their own project logic, or maintain a module which uses it, should consider passing `true` to `setCheckPermissions()` if the data is provided by users."
