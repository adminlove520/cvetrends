Prior to version 1.0.0-rc.3, notation-go users will find their application using excessive memory when verifying signatures. The application will be killed, and thus availability is impacted. The problem has been patched in the release v1.0.0-rc.3. Some workarounds are available. Users can review their own trust policy file and check if the identity string contains `=#`. Meanwhile, users should only put trusted certificates in their trust stores referenced by their own trust policy files, and make sure the `authenticity` validation is set to `enforce`."

        "summary": "The Notary Project is a set of specifications and tools intended to provide a cross-industry standard for securing software supply chains by using authentic container images and other OCI artifacts. An external actor with control of a compromised container registry can provide outdated versions of OCI artifacts, such as Images. This could lead artifact consumers with relaxed trust policies (such as `permissive` instead of `strict`) to potentially use artifacts with signatures that are no longer valid, making them susceptible to any exploits those artifacts may contain. In Notary Project, an artifact publisher can control the validity period of artifact by specifying signature expiry during the signing process. Using shorter signature validity periods along with processes to periodically resign artifacts, allows artifact producers to ensure that their consumers will only receive up-to-date artifacts. Artifact consumers should correspondingly use a `strict` or equivalent trust policy that enforces signature expiry. Together these steps enable use of up-to-date artifacts and safeguard against rollback attack in the event of registry compromise. The Notary Project offers various signature validation options such as `permissive`, `audit` and `skip` to support various scenarios. These scenarios includes 1) situations demanding urgent workload deployment, necessitating the bypassing of expired or revoked signatures; 2) auditing of artifacts lacking signatures without interrupting workload; and 3) skipping of verification for specific images that might have undergone validation through alternative mechanisms. Additionally, the Notary Project supports revocation to ensure the signature freshness. Artifact publishers can sign with short-lived certificates and revoke older certificates when necessary. This revocation serves as a signal to inform artifact consumers that the corresponding unexpired artifact is no longer approved by the publisher. This enables the artifact publisher to control the validity of the signature independently of their ability to manage artifacts in a compromised registry."

Retrieving + printing the protocol (harmless race):\n\n\tif (!hidpp->protocol_major) {\n\t\thidpp_root_get_protocol_version()\n\t\thidpp->protocol_major = response.rap.params[0];\n\t}\n\nWe can actually see this race hit in the dmesg in the abrt output\nattached to rhbz#2227968:\n\n[ 3064.624215] logitech-hidpp-device 0003:046D:4071.0049: HID++ 4.5 device connected.\n[ 3064.658184] logitech-hidpp-device 0003:046D:4071.0049: HID++ 4.5 device connected.\n\nTesting with extra logging added has shown that after this the 2 threads\ntake turn grabbing the hw access mutex (send_mutex) so they ping-pong\nthrough all the other TOCTOU cases managing to hit all of them:\n\n2. Updating the name to the HIDPP name (harmless race):\n\n\tif (hidpp->name == hdev->name) {\n\t\t...\n\t\thidpp->name = new_name;\n\t}\n\n3. Initializing the power_supply class for the battery (problematic!):\n\nhidpp_initialize_battery()\n{\n        if (hidpp->battery.ps)\n                return 0;\n\n\tprobe_battery(); /* Blocks, threads take turns executing this */\n\n\thidpp->battery.desc.properties =\n\t\tdevm_kmemdup(dev, hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL);\n\n\thidpp->battery.ps =\n\t\tdevm_power_supply_register(&hidpp->hid_dev->dev,\n\t\t\t\t\t   &hidpp->battery.desc, cfg);\n}\n\n4. Creating delayed input_device (potentially problematic):\n\n\tif (hidpp->delayed_input)\n\t\treturn;\n\n\thidpp->delayed_input = hidpp_allocate_input(hdev);\n\nThe really big problem here is 3. Hitting the race leads to the following\nsequence:\n\n\thidpp->battery.desc.properties =\n\t\tdevm_kmemdup(dev, hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL);\n\n\thidpp->battery.ps =\n\t\tdevm_power_supply_register(&hidpp->hid_dev->dev,\n\t\t\t\t\t   &hidpp->battery.desc, cfg);\n\n\t...\n\n\thidpp->battery.desc.properties =\n\t\tdevm_kmemdup(dev, hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL);\n\n\thidpp->battery.ps =\n\t\tdevm_power_supply_register(&hidpp->hid_dev->dev,\n\t\t\t\t\t   &hidpp->battery.desc, cfg);\n\nSo now we have registered 2 power supplies for the same battery,\nwhich looks a bit weird from userspace's pov but this is not even\nthe really big problem.\n\nNotice how:\n\n1. This is all devm-maganaged\n2. The hidpp->battery.desc struct is shared between the 2 power supplies\n3. hidpp->battery.desc.properties points to the result from the second\n   devm_kmemdup()\n\nThis causes a use after free scenario on USB disconnect of the receiver:\n1. The last registered power supply class device gets unregistered\n2. The memory from the last devm_kmemdup() call gets freed,\n   hidpp->battery.desc.properties now points to freed memory\n3. The first registered power supply class device gets unregistered,\n   this involves sending a remove uevent to userspace which invokes\n   power_supply_uevent() to fill the uevent data\n4. power_supply_uevent() uses hidpp->battery.desc.properties which\n   now points to freed memory leading to backtraces like this one:\n\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel: BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffb2140e017f08\n...\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel: Workqueue: usb_hub_wq hub_event\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel: RIP: 0010:power_supply_uevent+0xee/0x1d0\n...\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  ? asm_exc_page_fault+0x26/0x30\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  ? power_supply_uevent+0xee/0x1d0\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  ? power_supply_uevent+0x10d/0x1d0\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  dev_uevent+0x10f/0x2d0\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  kobject_uevent_env+0x291/0x680\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  \n---truncated---"
