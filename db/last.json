It appears to be an (unwritten?) assumption in the rest of the Linux network stack that packet protocol headers are all contained within the linear section of the SKB and some NICs behave badly if this is not the case. This has been reported to occur with Cisco (enic) and Broadcom NetXtrem II BCM5780 (bnx2x) though it may be an issue with other NICs/drivers as well. In case the frontend is sending requests with split headers, netback will forward those violating above mentioned assumption to the networking core, resulting in said misbehavior."

        "summary": "aad-pod-identity assigns Azure Active Directory identities to Kubernetes applications and has now been deprecated as of 24 October 2022. The NMI component in AAD Pod Identity intercepts and validates token requests based on regex. In this case, a token request made with backslash in the request (example: `/metadata/identity\\oauth2\\token/`) would bypass the NMI validation and be sent to IMDS allowing a pod in the cluster to access identities that it shouldn't have access to. This issue has been fixed and has been included in AAD Pod Identity release version 1.8.13. If using the AKS pod-managed identities add-on, no action is required. The clusters should now be running the version 1.8.13 release."
