This in particular means that they may set registers used\nto pass 32-bit-mode hypercall arguments to values outside of the range\n32-bit code would be able to set them to.\n\nWhen processing of hypercalls takes a considerable amount of time,\nthe hypervisor may choose to invoke a hypercall continuation.  Doing so\ninvolves putting (perhaps updated) hypercall arguments in respective\nregisters.  For guests not running in 64-bit mode this further involves\na certain amount of translation of the values.\n\nUnfortunately internal sanity checking of these translated values\nassumes high halves of registers to always be clear when invoking a\nhypercall.  When this is found not to be the case, it triggers a\nconsistency check in the hypervisor and causes a crash.\n"

The vulnerability arises from the application's handling of artifact URLs, where a '#' character can be used to insert a path into the fragment, effectively skipping validation. This allows an attacker to construct a URL that, when processed, ignores the protocol scheme and uses the provided path for filesystem access. As a result, an attacker can read arbitrary files, including sensitive information such as SSH and cloud keys, by exploiting the way the application converts the URL into a filesystem path. The issue stems from insufficient validation of the fragment portion of the URL, leading to arbitrary file read through path traversal."

Attackers can exploit this by crafting a payload that includes relative path traversal sequences ('../../../'), enabling them to navigate to arbitrary directories. This flaw subsequently allows the server to load and execute a malicious '__init__.py' file, leading to remote code execution. The issue affects the latest version of parisneo/lollms-webui."
