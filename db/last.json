User supplied JSON POST data is parsed and if \"id\" JSON key does not exist, JSON value supplied via \"ip\" JSON key is assigned to the \"ip\" variable. Later on, \"ip\" variable which can be controlled by the attacker is used when constructing the cmd and cmd1 strings without any extra validation. Then, server_mod.subprocess_execute function is called on both cmd1 and cmd2. When the definition of the server_mod.subprocess_execute() function is analyzed, it can be seen that subprocess.Popen() is called on the input parameter with shell=True which results in OS Command Injection.

Because BPF tracing programs can be\ninvoked from any interrupt context, locks taken during a map_delete_elem\noperation must be hardirq-safe. Otherwise a deadlock due to lock inversion\nis possible, as reported by lockdep:\n\n       CPU0                    CPU1\n       ----                    ----\n  lock(&htab->buckets[i].lock);\n                               local_irq_disable();\n                               lock(&host->lock);\n                               lock(&htab->buckets[i].lock);\n  <Interrupt>\n    lock(&host->lock);\n\nLocks in sockmap are hardirq-unsafe by design. We expects elements to be\ndeleted from sockmap/sockhash only in task (normal) context with interrupts\nenabled, or in softirq context.\n\nDetect when map_delete_elem operation is invoked from a context which is\n_not_ hardirq-unsafe, that is interrupts are disabled, and bail out with an\nerror.\n\nNote that map updates are not affected by this issue. BPF verifier does not\nallow updating sockmap/sockhash from a BPF tracing program today."
