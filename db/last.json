This is a react component to render data coming from Webiny Headless CMS and Webiny Form Builder. Webiny is an open-source serverless enterprise CMS. The @webiny/react-rich-text-renderer package depends on the editor.js rich text editor to handle rich text content. The CMS stores rich text content from the editor.js into the database. When the @webiny/react-rich-text-renderer is used to render such content, it uses the dangerouslySetInnerHTML prop, without applying HTML sanitization. The issue arises when an actor, who in this context would specifically be a content manager with access to the CMS, inserts a malicious script as part of the user-defined input. This script is then injected and executed within the user's browser when the main page or admin page loads."

It primarily affects servers (such as HTTP servers) that use TLS client authentication. If a TLS server-side socket is created, receives data into the socket buffer, and then is closed quickly, there is a brief window where the SSLSocket instance will detect the socket as \"not connected\" and won't initiate a handshake, but buffered data will still be readable from the socket buffer. This data will not be authenticated if the server-side TLS peer is expecting client certificate authentication, and is indistinguishable from valid TLS stream data. Data is limited in size to the amount that will fit in the buffer. (The TLS connection cannot directly be used for data exfiltration because the vulnerable code path requires that the connection be closed on initialization of the SSLSocket.)"

This bug affects Datasette instances running a Datasette 1.0 alpha - 1.0a0, 1.0a1, 1.0a2 or 1.0a3 - in an online accessible location but with authentication enabled using a plugin such as datasette-auth-passwords. The `/-/api` API explorer endpoint could reveal the names of both databases and tables - but not their contents - to an unauthenticated user. Datasette 1.0a4 has a fix for this issue. This will block access to the API explorer but will still allow access to the Datasette read or write JSON APIs, as those use different URL patterns within the Datasette `/database` hierarchy. This issue is patched in version 1.0a4."
