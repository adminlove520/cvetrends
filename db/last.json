The Contiki-NG operating system for IoT devices contains a Bluetooth Low Energy stack. An attacker can inject a packet in this stack, which causes the implementation to dereference a NULL pointer and triggers undefined behavior. More specifically, while processing the L2CAP protocol, the implementation maps an incoming channel ID to its metadata structure. In this structure, state information regarding credits is managed through calls to the function input_l2cap_credit in the module os/net/mac/ble/ble-l2cap.c. Unfortunately, the input_l2cap_credit function does not check that the metadata corresponding to the user-supplied channel ID actually exists, which can lead to the channel variable being set to NULL before a pointer dereferencing operation is performed. The vulnerability has been patched in the \"develop\" branch of Contiki-NG, and will be included in release 4.9. Users can apply the patch in Contiki-NG pull request #2253 as a workaround until the new package is released."

This affects the function before of the file fuel/app/classes/controller/api.php of the component API Controller. The manipulation leads to cross-site request forgery. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. Upgrading to version 9.0.2-alpha2 is able to address this issue. The name of the patch is af259115d2e8f17068e61902151ee8a9dbac397b. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The identifier VDB-215973 was assigned to this vulnerability."

This leads to a scenario in which the application is calling itself recursively - amplifying the impact of the initial attack until the limits of the web server are exceeded. This vulnerability is very similar, but not identical, to the one described in CVE-2021-21359. This issue is patched in versions 9.5.38 ELTS, 10.4.33, 11.5.20 or 12.1.1."
