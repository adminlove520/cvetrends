This non-implementation resulted in the bad actor being able to exploit this vulnerability without using the GUI. In our testing (not exhaustive, as not all numerical versions of major browsers were tested) the malicious file does not get executed on the client. There are reports of others based on backbone telemetry observations of a 3rd party provider, however these are unconfirmed to date."

This results in the VF potentially removing\nits DMA memory before the PF has shut down the device queues.\n\nAdditionally, the fix doesn't actually resolve concurrency issues within\nthe ice driver. It is possible for a VF to initiate a reset just prior\nto the ice driver removing VFs. This can result in the remove task\nconcurrently operating while the VF is being reset. This results in\nsimilar memory corruption and panics purportedly fixed by that commit.\n\nFix this concurrency at its root by protecting both the reset and\nremoval flows using the existing VF cfg_lock. This ensures that we\ncannot remove the VF while any outstanding critical tasks such as a\nvirtchnl message or a reset are occurring.\n\nThis locking change also fixes the root cause originally fixed by commit\nc503e63200c6 (\"ice: Stop processing VF messages during teardown\"), so we\ncan simply revert it.\n\nNote that I kept these two changes together because simply reverting the\noriginal commit alone would leave the driver vulnerable to worse race\nconditions."

When the umount operation is executed,\ntop_cpuset.css.cgrp will be rebound to &cgrp_dfl_root.cgrp.\n\nThe problem is that when rebinding to cgrp_dfl_root, there are cases\nwhere the cgroup_root allocated by setting up the root for cgroup v1\nis cached. This could lead to a Use-After-Free (UAF) if it is\nsubsequently freed. The descendant cgroups of cgroup v1 can only be\nfreed after the css is released. However, the css of the root will never\nbe released, yet the cgroup_root should be freed when it is unmounted.\nThis means that obtaining a reference to the css of the root does\nnot guarantee that css.cgrp->root will not be freed.\n\nFix this problem by using rcu_read_lock in proc_cpuset_show().\nAs cgroup_root is kfree_rcu after commit d23b5c577715\n(\"cgroup: Make operations on the cgroup root_list RCU safe\"),\ncss->cgroup won't be freed during the critical section.\nTo call cgroup_path_ns_locked, css_set_lock is needed, so it is safe to\nreplace task_get_css with task_css.\n\n[1] https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=9b1ff7be974a403aa4cd"

        "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmd: fix deadlock between mddev_suspend and flush bio\n\nDeadlock occurs when mddev is being suspended while some flush bio is in\nprogress. It is a complex issue.\n\nT1. the first flush is at the ending stage, it clears 'mddev->flush_bio'\n    and tries to submit data, but is blocked because mddev is suspended\n    by T4.\nT2. the second flush sets 'mddev->flush_bio', and attempts to queue\n    md_submit_flush_data(), which is already running (T1) and won't\n    execute again if on the same CPU as T1.\nT3. the third flush inc active_io and tries to flush, but is blocked because\n    'mddev->flush_bio' is not NULL (set by T2).\nT4. mddev_suspend() is called and waits for active_io dec to 0 which is inc\n    by T3.\n\n  T1\t\tT2\t\tT3\t\tT4\n  (flush 1)\t(flush 2)\t(third 3)\t(suspend)\n  md_submit_flush_data\n   mddev->flush_bio = NULL;\n   .\n   .\t \tmd_flush_request\n   .\t  \t mddev->flush_bio = bio\n   .\t  \t queue submit_flushes\n   .\t\t .\n   .\t\t .\t\tmd_handle_request\n   .\t\t .\t\t active_io + 1\n   .\t\t .\t\t md_flush_request\n   .\t\t .\t\t  wait !mddev->flush_bio\n   .\t\t .\n   .\t\t .\t\t\t\tmddev_suspend\n   .\t\t .\t\t\t\t wait !active_io\n   .\t\t .\n   .\t\t submit_flushes\n   .\t\t queue_work md_submit_flush_data\n   .\t\t //md_submit_flush_data is already running (T1)\n   .\n   md_handle_request\n    wait resume\n\nThe root issue is non-atomic inc/dec of active_io during flush process.\nactive_io is dec before md_submit_flush_data is queued, and inc soon\nafter md_submit_flush_data() run.\n  md_flush_request\n    active_io + 1\n    submit_flushes\n      active_io - 1\n      md_submit_flush_data\n        md_handle_request\n        active_io + 1\n          make_request\n        active_io - 1\n\nIf active_io is dec after md_handle_request() instead of within\nsubmit_flushes(), make_request() can be called directly intead of\nmd_handle_request() in md_submit_flush_data(), and active_io will\nonly inc and dec once in the whole flush process. Deadlock will be\nfixed.\n\nAdditionally, the only difference between fixing the issue and before is\nthat there is no return error handling of make_request(). But after\nprevious patch cleaned md_write_start(), make_requst() only return error\nin raid5_make_request() by dm-raid, see commit 41425f96d7aa (\"dm-raid456,\nmd/raid456: fix a deadlock for dm-raid456 while io concurrent with\nreshape)\". Since dm always splits data and flush operation into two\nseparate io, io size of flush submitted by dm always is 0, make_request()\nwill not be called in md_submit_flush_data(). To prevent future\nmodifications from introducing issues, add WARN_ON to ensure\nmake_request() no error is returned in this context."
