The vulnerability impacts applications which use referencevalidator to process XML resources from untrusted sources. The problem has been patched with the 2.5.1 version of the referencevalidator.

However, calling `retry()` on an unvalidated connection exposes the server to a likely panic in the following situations:  1. Calling `refuse` or `ignore` on the resulting validated connection, if a duplicate initial packet is received. This issue can go undetected until a server's `refuse()`/`ignore()` code path is exercised, such as to stop a denial of service attack. 2. Accepting when the initial packet for the resulting validated connection fails to decrypt or exhausts connection IDs, if a similar initial packet that successfully decrypts and doesn't exhaust connection IDs is received. This issue can go undetected if clients are well-behaved. The former situation was observed in a real application, while the latter is only theoretical."

Users across other organizations can still log in and access through these applications, leading to unauthorized access. Additionally, if a project was deactivated access to applications was also still possible. The issue stems from the fact that when an organization is deactivated in Zitadel, the applications associated with it do not automatically deactivate. The application lifecycle is not tightly coupled with the organization's lifecycle, leading to a situation where the organization or project is marked as inactive, but its resources remain accessible. This vulnerability allows for unauthorized access to projects and their resources, which should have been restricted post-organization deactivation. Versions 2.62.1, 2.61.1, 2.60.2, 2.59.3, 2.58.5, 2.57.5, 2.56.6, 2.55.8, and 2.54.10 have been released which address this issue. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may explicitly disable the application to make sure the client is not allowed anymore."

This vulnerability allows for arbitrary file reading when the application is running on Windows. The issue arises due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input, enabling attackers to bypass the path traversal protection mechanisms by crafting malicious input. Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files, information disclosure, and potentially a denial of service (DoS) condition by including numerous large or resource-intensive files. This vulnerability affects the latest version prior to 9.6."
