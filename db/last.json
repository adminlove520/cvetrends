This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of GStreamer.

The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-22873."
