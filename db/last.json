Using a software state to track whether or not we need to start\n   the process to exit idle or notify idle.\n\nIt's possible for the hardware to have exited an idle state without\ndriver knowledge, but entering one is always restricted to a driver\nallow - which makes the SW state vs HW state mismatch issue purely one\nof optimization, which should seldomly be hit, if at all.\n\n2. Refactor any instances of exit/notify idle to use a single wrapper\n   that maintains this SW state.\n\nThis works simialr to dc_allow_idle_optimizations, but works at the\nDMCUB level and makes sure the state is marked prior to any notify/exit\nidle so we don't enter an infinite loop.\n\n3. Make sure we exit out of idle prior to sending any commands or\n   waiting for DMCUB idle.\n\nThis patch takes care of 1/2.

Memory corruption may also occur\nin such a scenario.\n\nTo prevent the described memory corruption, disable HFI when preparing to\nsuspend or hibernate. Enable it when resuming.\n\nAdd syscore callbacks to handle the package of the boot CPU (packages of\nnon-boot CPUs are handled via CPU offline). Syscore ops always run on the\nboot CPU.

        "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nplatform/x86: p2sb: Allow p2sb_bar() calls during PCI device probe\n\np2sb_bar() unhides P2SB device to get resources from the device. It\nguards the operation by locking pci_rescan_remove_lock so that parallel\nrescans do not find the P2SB device. However, this lock causes deadlock\nwhen PCI bus rescan is triggered by /sys/bus/pci/rescan. The rescan\nlocks pci_rescan_remove_lock and probes PCI devices. When PCI devices\ncall p2sb_bar() during probe, it locks pci_rescan_remove_lock again.\nHence the deadlock.\n\nTo avoid the deadlock, do not lock pci_rescan_remove_lock in p2sb_bar().\nInstead, do the lock at fs_initcall. Introduce p2sb_cache_resources()\nfor fs_initcall which gets and caches the P2SB resources. At p2sb_bar(),\nrefer the cache and return to the caller.\n\nBefore operating the device at P2SB DEVFN for resource cache, check\nthat its device class is PCI_CLASS_MEMORY_OTHER 0x0580 that PCH\nspecifications define. This avoids unexpected operation to other devices\nat the same DEVFN.\n\nTested-by Klara Modin <klarasmodin@gmail.com>"

In the case Airflow is run with the root user (not recommended) it added group write permission to all folders up to the root of the filesystem.\n\nIf your log files are stored in the home directory, these permission changes might impact your ability to run SSH operations after your home directory becomes group-writeable.\n\nThis issue does not affect users who use or extend Airflow using Official Airflow Docker reference images ( https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/airflow/ ) - those images require to have group write permission set anyway.\n\nYou are affected only if you install Airflow using local installation / virtualenv or other Docker images, but the issue has no impact if docker containers are used as intended, i.e. where Airflow components do not share containers with other applications and users.\n\nAlso you should not be affected if your umask is 002 (group write enabled) - this is the default on many linux systems.\n\nRecommendation for users using Airflow outside of the containers:\n\n  *  if you are using root to run Airflow, change your Airflow user to use non-root\n  *  upgrade Apache Airflow to 2.8.4 or above\n  *  If you prefer not to upgrade, you can change the  https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/configurations-ref.html#file-task-handler-new-folder-permissions \u00a0to 0o755 (original value 0o775).\n  *  if you already ran Airflow tasks before and your default umask is 022 (group write disabled) you should stop Airflow components, check permissions of AIRFLOW_HOME/logs\u00a0in all your components and all parent directories of this directory and remove group write access for all the parent directories\n\n"
