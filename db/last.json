The pipe\ncontext passed to dcn35_set_drr() is a member of this resource context.\n\nIf dc_state_destruct() is called parallel to the IRQ processing (which\ncalls dcn35_set_drr() at some point), we can end up using already nulled\nfunction callback fields of struct stream_resource.\n\nThe logic in dcn35_set_drr() already tries to avoid this, by checking tg\nagainst NULL.

A minimum\nperiod of 32 is enforced for the rest of the events.\nThe recommended workaround code of the HSW143 is not implemented.\nBecause it only addresses the issue for the fixed counter.
