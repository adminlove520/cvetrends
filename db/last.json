An attacker can cause an integer wraparound or under-allocation or heap buffer overflow due to vulnerabilities in parameter checking mechanism, by exploiting the buffer length parameter in Azure C SDK, which may lead to remote code execution. Requirements for RCE are 1. Compromised Azure account allowing malformed payloads to be sent to the device via IoT Hub service, 2. By passing IoT hub service max message payload limit of 128KB, and 3. Ability to overwrite code space with remote code.

When a user of Express performs a redirect using a user-provided URL Express performs an encode [using `encodeurl`](https://github.com/pillarjs/encodeurl) on the contents before passing it to the `location` header. This can cause malformed URLs to be evaluated in unexpected ways by common redirect allow list implementations in Express applications, leading to an Open Redirect via bypass of a properly implemented allow list.
