        "summary": "libuv is a multi-platform support library with a focus on asynchronous I/O. The `uv_getaddrinfo` function in `src/unix/getaddrinfo.c` (and its windows counterpart `src/win/getaddrinfo.c`), truncates hostnames to 256 characters before calling `getaddrinfo`. This behavior can be exploited to create addresses like `0x00007f000001`, which are considered valid by `getaddrinfo` and could allow an attacker to craft payloads that resolve to unintended IP addresses, bypassing developer checks. The vulnerability arises due to how the `hostname_ascii` variable (with a length of 256 bytes) is handled in `uv_getaddrinfo` and subsequently in `uv__idna_toascii`. When the hostname exceeds 256 characters, it gets truncated without a terminating null byte. As a result attackers may be able to access internal APIs or for websites (similar to MySpace) that allows users to have `username.example.com` pages. Internal services that crawl or cache these user pages can be exposed to SSRF attacks if a malicious user chooses a long vulnerable username. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.48.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."

While certain services operate within the confines of limited PCP user/group privileges, others are granted full root privileges. This disparity in privilege levels poses a risk when privileged root processes interact with directories or directory trees owned by unprivileged PCP users. Specifically, this vulnerability may lead to the compromise of PCP user isolation and facilitate local PCP-to-root exploits, particularly through symlink attacks. These vulnerabilities underscore the importance of maintaining robust privilege separation mechanisms within PCP to mitigate the potential for unauthorized privilege escalation."

Thus when dwc->gadget is freed,\nthe first dwc3_ep in the list now has a dangling prev pointer and\nlikewise for the next pointer of the dwc3_ep at the tail of the list.\nThe dwc3_gadget_free_endpoints() that follows will result in a\nuse-after-free when it calls list_del().\n\nThis was caught by enabling KASAN and performing a driver unbind.\nThe recent commit 568262bf5492 (\"usb: dwc3: core: Add shutdown\ncallback for dwc3\") also exposes this as a panic during shutdown.\n\nThere are a few possibilities to fix this.  One could be to perform\na list_del() of the gadget->ep_list itself which removes it from\nthe rest of the dwc3_ep chain.\n\nAnother approach is what this patch does, by splitting up the\nusb_del_gadget_udc() call into its separate \"del\" and \"put\"\ncomponents.  This allows dwc3_gadget_free_endpoints() to be\ncalled before the gadget is finally freed with usb_put_gadget()."

In case the\nfirst extent record in catalog file gets full, new ones are allocated from\nextents overflow file.\n\nIn case shrinking truncate happens to middle of an extent record which\nlocates in extents overflow file, the logic in hfsplus_file_truncate() was\nchanged so that call to hfs_brec_remove() is not guarded any more.\n\nRight action would be just freeing the extents that exceed the new size\ninside extent record by calling hfsplus_free_extents(), and then check if\nthe whole extent record should be removed.  However since the guard\n(blk_cnt > start) is now after the call to hfs_brec_remove(), this has\nunfortunate effect that the last matching extent record is removed\nunconditionally.\n\nTo reproduce this issue, create a file which has at least 10 extents, and\nthen perform shrinking truncate into middle of the last extent record, so\nthat the number of remaining extents is not under or divisible by 8.  This\ncauses the last extent record (8 extents) to be removed totally instead of\ntruncating into middle of it.  Thus this causes corruption, and lost data.\n\nFix for this is simply checking if the new truncated end is below the\nstart of this extent record, making it safe to remove the full extent\nrecord.  However call to hfs_brec_remove() can't be moved to it's previous\nplace since we're dropping ->tree_lock and it can cause a race condition\nand the cached info being invalidated possibly corrupting the node data.\n\nAnother issue is related to this one.  When entering into the block\n(blk_cnt > start) we are not holding the ->tree_lock.  We break out from\nthe loop not holding the lock, but hfs_find_exit() does unlock it.  Not\nsure if it's possible for someone else to take the lock under our feet,\nbut it can cause hard to debug errors and premature unlocking.  Even if\nthere's no real risk of it, the locking should still always be kept in\nbalance.  Thus taking the lock now just before the check."

With this done, we can remove the existing special\ncases which set this later in the entry code.\n\nWe always use (GIC_PRIO_IRQON | GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET) for consistency with\nlocal_daif_save(), as this will warn if it ever encounters\n(GIC_PRIO_IRQOFF | GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET), and never sets this itself. This\nmatches the gic_prio_kentry_setup that we have to retain for\nret_to_user.\n\nThe original splat from Zenghui's report was:\n\n| DEBUG_LOCKS_WARN_ON(!irqs_disabled())\n| WARNING: CPU: 3 PID: 125 at kernel/locking/lockdep.c:4258 lockdep_hardirqs_off+0xd4/0xe8\n| Modules linked in:\n| CPU: 3 PID: 125 Comm: modprobe Tainted: G        W         5.12.0-rc8+ #463\n| Hardware name: QEMU KVM Virtual Machine, BIOS 0.0.0 02/06/2015\n| pstate: 604003c5 (nZCv DAIF +PAN -UAO -TCO BTYPE=--)\n| pc : lockdep_hardirqs_off+0xd4/0xe8\n| lr : lockdep_hardirqs_off+0xd4/0xe8\n| sp : ffff80002a39bad0\n| pmr_save: 000000e0\n| x29: ffff80002a39bad0 x28: ffff0000de214bc0\n| x27: ffff0000de1c0400 x26: 000000000049b328\n| x25: 0000000000406f30 x24: ffff0000de1c00a0\n| x23: 0000000020400005 x22: ffff8000105f747c\n| x21: 0000000096000044 x20: 0000000000498ef9\n| x19: ffff80002a39bc88 x18: ffffffffffffffff\n| x17: 0000000000000000 x16: ffff800011c61eb0\n| x15: ffff800011700a88 x14: 0720072007200720\n| x13: 0720072007200720 x12: 0720072007200720\n| x11: 0720072007200720 x10: 0720072007200720\n| x9 : ffff80002a39bad0 x8 : ffff80002a39bad0\n| x7 : ffff8000119f0800 x6 : c0000000ffff7fff\n| x5 : ffff8000119f07a8 x4 : 0000000000000001\n| x3 : 9bcdab23f2432800 x2 : ffff800011730538\n| x1 : 9bcdab23f2432800 x0 : 0000000000000000\n| Call trace:\n|  lockdep_hardirqs_off+0xd4/0xe8\n|  enter_from_kernel_mode.isra.5+0x7c/0xa8\n|  el1_abort+0x24/0x100\n|  el1_sync_handler+0x80/0xd0\n|  el1_sync+0x6c/0x100\n|  __arch_clear_user+0xc/0x90\n|  load_elf_binary+0x9fc/0x1450\n|  bprm_execve+0x404/0x880\n|  kernel_execve+0x180/0x188\n|  call_usermodehelper_exec_async+0xdc/0x158\n|  ret_from_fork+0x10/0x18"

        "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: fix deadlock when cloning inline extents and using qgroups\n\nThere are a few exceptional cases where cloning an inline extent needs to\ncopy the inline extent data into a page of the destination inode.\n\nWhen this happens, we end up starting a transaction while having a dirty\npage for the destination inode and while having the range locked in the\ndestination's inode iotree too. Because when reserving metadata space\nfor a transaction we may need to flush existing delalloc in case there is\nnot enough free space, we have a mechanism in place to prevent a deadlock,\nwhich was introduced in commit 3d45f221ce627d (\"btrfs: fix deadlock when\ncloning inline extent and low on free metadata space\").\n\nHowever when using qgroups, a transaction also reserves metadata qgroup\nspace, which can also result in flushing delalloc in case there is not\nenough available space at the moment. When this happens we deadlock, since\nflushing delalloc requires locking the file range in the inode's iotree\nand the range was already locked at the very beginning of the clone\noperation, before attempting to start the transaction.\n\nWhen this issue happens, stack traces like the following are reported:\n\n  [72747.556262] task:kworker/u81:9   state:D stack:    0 pid:  225 ppid:     2 flags:0x00004000\n  [72747.556268] Workqueue: writeback wb_workfn (flush-btrfs-1142)\n  [72747.556271] Call Trace:\n  [72747.556273]  __schedule+0x296/0x760\n  [72747.556277]  schedule+0x3c/0xa0\n  [72747.556279]  io_schedule+0x12/0x40\n  [72747.556284]  __lock_page+0x13c/0x280\n  [72747.556287]  ? generic_file_readonly_mmap+0x70/0x70\n  [72747.556325]  extent_write_cache_pages+0x22a/0x440 [btrfs]\n  [72747.556331]  ? __set_page_dirty_nobuffers+0xe7/0x160\n  [72747.556358]  ? set_extent_buffer_dirty+0x5e/0x80 [btrfs]\n  [72747.556362]  ? update_group_capacity+0x25/0x210\n  [72747.556366]  ? cpumask_next_and+0x1a/0x20\n  [72747.556391]  extent_writepages+0x44/0xa0 [btrfs]\n  [72747.556394]  do_writepages+0x41/0xd0\n  [72747.556398]  __writeback_single_inode+0x39/0x2a0\n  [72747.556403]  writeback_sb_inodes+0x1ea/0x440\n  [72747.556407]  __writeback_inodes_wb+0x5f/0xc0\n  [72747.556410]  wb_writeback+0x235/0x2b0\n  [72747.556414]  ? get_nr_inodes+0x35/0x50\n  [72747.556417]  wb_workfn+0x354/0x490\n  [72747.556420]  ? newidle_balance+0x2c5/0x3e0\n  [72747.556424]  process_one_work+0x1aa/0x340\n  [72747.556426]  worker_thread+0x30/0x390\n  [72747.556429]  ? create_worker+0x1a0/0x1a0\n  [72747.556432]  kthread+0x116/0x130\n  [72747.556435]  ? kthread_park+0x80/0x80\n  [72747.556438]  ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30\n\n  [72747.566958] Workqueue: btrfs-flush_delalloc btrfs_work_helper [btrfs]\n  [72747.566961] Call Trace:\n  [72747.566964]  __schedule+0x296/0x760\n  [72747.566968]  ? finish_wait+0x80/0x80\n  [72747.566970]  schedule+0x3c/0xa0\n  [72747.566995]  wait_extent_bit.constprop.68+0x13b/0x1c0 [btrfs]\n  [72747.566999]  ? finish_wait+0x80/0x80\n  [72747.567024]  lock_extent_bits+0x37/0x90 [btrfs]\n  [72747.567047]  btrfs_invalidatepage+0x299/0x2c0 [btrfs]\n  [72747.567051]  ? find_get_pages_range_tag+0x2cd/0x380\n  [72747.567076]  __extent_writepage+0x203/0x320 [btrfs]\n  [72747.567102]  extent_write_cache_pages+0x2bb/0x440 [btrfs]\n  [72747.567106]  ? update_load_avg+0x7e/0x5f0\n  [72747.567109]  ? enqueue_entity+0xf4/0x6f0\n  [72747.567134]  extent_writepages+0x44/0xa0 [btrfs]\n  [72747.567137]  ? enqueue_task_fair+0x93/0x6f0\n  [72747.567140]  do_writepages+0x41/0xd0\n  [72747.567144]  __filemap_fdatawrite_range+0xc7/0x100\n  [72747.567167]  btrfs_run_delalloc_work+0x17/0x40 [btrfs]\n  [72747.567195]  btrfs_work_helper+0xc2/0x300 [btrfs]\n  [72747.567200]  process_one_work+0x1aa/0x340\n  [72747.567202]  worker_thread+0x30/0x390\n  [72747.567205]  ? create_worker+0x1a0/0x1a0\n  [72747.567208]  kthread+0x116/0x130\n  [72747.567211]  ? kthread_park+0x80/0x80\n  [72747.567214]  ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30\n\n  [72747.569686] task:fsstress        state:D stack:    \n---truncated---"

The new\nAPIs introduce a struct obj_cgroup to charge slab objects.  It prevents\nlong-living objects from pinning the original memory cgroup in the\nmemory.  But there are still some corner objects (e.g.  allocations\nlarger than order-1 page on SLUB) which are not charged with the new\nAPIs.  Those objects (include the pages which are allocated from buddy\nallocator directly) are charged as kmem pages which still hold a\nreference to the memory cgroup.\n\nE.g.  We know that the kernel stack is charged as kmem pages because the\nsize of the kernel stack can be greater than 2 pages (e.g.  16KB on\nx86_64 or arm64).  If we create a thread (suppose the thread stack is\ncharged to memory cgroup A) and then move it from memory cgroup A to\nmemory cgroup B.  Because the kernel stack of the thread hold a\nreference to the memory cgroup A.  The thread can pin the memory cgroup\nA in the memory even if we remove the cgroup A.  If we want to see this\nscenario by using the following script.  We can see that the system has\nadded 500 dying cgroups (This is not a real world issue, just a script\nto show that the large kmallocs are charged as kmem pages which can pin\nthe memory cgroup in the memory).\n\n\t#!/bin/bash\n\n\tcat /proc/cgroups | grep memory\n\n\tcd /sys/fs/cgroup/memory\n\techo 1 > memory.move_charge_at_immigrate\n\n\tfor i in range{1..500}\n\tdo\n\t\tmkdir kmem_test\n\t\techo $$ > kmem_test/cgroup.procs\n\t\tsleep 3600 &\n\t\techo $$ > cgroup.procs\n\t\techo `cat kmem_test/cgroup.procs` > cgroup.procs\n\t\trmdir kmem_test\n\tdone\n\n\tcat /proc/cgroups | grep memory\n\nThis patchset aims to make those kmem pages to drop the reference to\nmemory cgroup by using the APIs of obj_cgroup.  Finally, we can see that\nthe number of the dying cgroups will not increase if we run the above test\nscript.\n\nThis patch (of 7):\n\nThe rcu_read_lock/unlock only can guarantee that the memcg will not be\nfreed, but it cannot guarantee the success of css_get (which is in the\nrefill_stock when cached memcg changed) to memcg.\n\n  rcu_read_lock()\n  memcg = obj_cgroup_memcg(old)\n  __memcg_kmem_uncharge(memcg)\n      refill_stock(memcg)\n          if (stock->cached != memcg)\n              // css_get can change the ref counter from 0 back to 1.\n              css_get(&memcg->css)\n  rcu_read_unlock()\n\nThis fix is very like the commit:\n\n  eefbfa7fd678 (\"mm: memcg/slab: fix use after free in obj_cgroup_charge\")\n\nFix this by holding a reference to the memcg which is passed to the\n__memcg_kmem_uncharge() before calling __memcg_kmem_uncharge()."
