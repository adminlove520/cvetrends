A malicious server can redirect the Commons Net code to use a different host, but the user has to connect to the malicious server in the first place. This may lead to leakage of information about services running on the private network of the client. The default in version 3.9.0 is now false to ignore such hosts, as cURL does.

When Netty's multipart decoders are used local information disclosure can occur via the local system temporary directory if temporary storing uploads on the disk is enabled. This only impacts applications running on Java version 6 and lower. Additionally, this vulnerability impacts code running on Unix-like systems, and very old versions of Mac OSX and Windows as they all share the system temporary directory between all users. Version 4.1.77.Final contains a patch for this vulnerability. As a workaround, specify one's own `java.io.tmpdir` when starting the JVM or use DefaultHttpDataFactory.setBaseDir(...) to set the directory to something that is only readable by the current user."
