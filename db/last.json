When using the Django integration of versions prior to 1.14.0 of the Sentry SDK in a specific configuration it is possible to leak sensitive cookies values, including the session cookie to Sentry. These sensitive cookies could then be used by someone with access to your Sentry issues to impersonate or escalate their privileges within your application. In order for these sensitive values to be leaked, the Sentry SDK configuration must have `sendDefaultPII` set to `True`; one must use a custom name for either `SESSION_COOKIE_NAME` or `CSRF_COOKIE_NAME` in one's Django settings; and one must not be configured in one's organization or project settings to use Sentry's data scrubbing features to account for the custom cookie names. As of version 1.14.0, the Django integration of the `sentry-sdk` will detect the custom cookie names based on one's Django settings and will remove the values from the payload before sending the data to Sentry. As a workaround, use the SDK's filtering mechanism to remove the cookies from the payload that is sent to Sentry. For error events, this can be done with the `before_send` callback method and for performance related events (transactions) one can use the `before_send_transaction` callback method. Those who want to handle filtering of these values on the server-side can also use Sentry's advanced data scrubbing feature to account for the custom cookie names. Look for the `$http.cookies`, `$http.headers`, `$request.cookies`, or `$request.headers` fields to target with a scrubbing rule."

The vulnerability may trigger a JavaScript code after fulfilling special conditions: using one of the affected packages on a web page with missing proper Content Security Policy configuration; initializing the editor on an element and using an element other than `<textarea>` as a base; and destroying the editor instance. This vulnerability might affect a small percentage of integrators that depend on dynamic editor initialization/destroy mechanism. A fix is available in CKEditor4 version 4.21.0. In some rare cases, a security fix may be considered a breaking change. Starting from version 4.21.0, the Iframe Dialog plugin applies the `sandbox` attribute by default, which restricts JavaScript code execution in the iframe element. To change this behavior, configure the `config.iframe_attributes` option. Also starting from version 4.21.0, the Media Embed plugin regenerates the entire content of the embed widget by default. To change this behavior, configure the `config.embed_keepOriginalContent` option. Those who choose to enable either of the more permissive options or who cannot upgrade to a patched version should properly configure Content Security Policy to avoid any potential security issues that may arise from embedding iframe elements on their web page."

Odd modulus uses the fast Montgomery multiplication, and even modulus uses the slow plain power algorithm. This gas cost discrepancy was not accounted for in the `modexp` precompile, leading to possible denial of service attacks. No fixes for `num-bigint` are currently available, and thus this issue is fixed in the short term by raising the gas costs for even modulus, and in the long term fixing it in `num-bigint` or switching to another modexp implementation. The short-term fix for Frontier is deployed at pull request 1017. There are no known workarounds aside from applying the fix."

If a Flatpak app is run on a Linux virtual console such as `/dev/tty1`, it can copy text from the virtual console and paste it into the command buffer, from which the command might be run after the Flatpak app has exited. Ordinary graphical terminal emulators like xterm, gnome-terminal and Konsole are unaffected. This vulnerability is specific to the Linux virtual consoles `/dev/tty1`, `/dev/tty2` and so on. A patch is available in versions 1.10.8, 1.12.8, 1.14.4, and 1.15.4. As a workaround, don't run Flatpak on a Linux virtual console.
