Under normal operation these files are ephemeral and are deleted once the Job in question runs. \n\nIn the default implementation used in Nautobot, as provided by `django-db-file-storage`, these URLs do not by default require any user authentication to access; they should instead be restricted to only users who have permissions to view Nautobot's `FileProxy` model instances.\n\nNote that no URL mechanism is provided for listing or traversal of the available file `name` values, so in practice an unauthenticated user would have to guess names to discover arbitrary files for download, but if a user knows the file name/path value, they can access it without authenticating, so we are considering this a vulnerability.\n\nFixes are included in Nautobot 1.6.7 and Nautobot 2.0.6. No known workarounds are available other than applying the patches included in those versions."

The messages recorded in the log may contain Account credentials for the kibana_system user, API Keys, and credentials of Kibana end-users, Elastic Security package policy objects which can contain private keys, bearer token, and sessions of 3rd-party integrations and finally Authorization headers, client secrets, local file paths, and stack traces. The issue may occur in any Kibana instance running an affected version that could potentially receive an unexpected error when communicating to Elasticsearch causing it to include sensitive data into Kibana error logs. It could also occur under specific circumstances when debug level logging is enabled in Kibana. Note: It was found that the fix for ESA-2023-25 in Kibana 8.11.1 for a similar issue was incomplete.\n"
