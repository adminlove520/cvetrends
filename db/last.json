This affects the function unzip_file of the file kuiper/app/controllers/case_management.py of the component TAR Archive Handler. The manipulation of the argument dst_path leads to path traversal. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitability is told to be difficult. Upgrading to version 2.3.5 is able to address this issue. The identifier of the patch is 94fa135153002f651f5526c55a7240e083db8d73. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The identifier VDB-248277 was assigned to this vulnerability."
