After memblock_init(),\nthose late calls of memblock_reserve() operate on subregions of memblock\n.memory regions. As a result, these reserved regions will be set to the\ncorrect node at the first iteration of memmap_init_reserved_pages().\n\nSo set all reserved memblocks on Node#0 at initialization can avoid this\npanic."
