For example, when\nthe cryptd queue for AESNI is full (easy to trigger with an\nartificially low cryptd.cryptd_max_cpu_qlen), requests will be enqueued\nto the backlog but still processed. In that case, the async callback\nwill also be called twice: first with err == -EINPROGRESS, which it\nseems we can just ignore, then with err == 0.\n\nCompared to Sabrina's original patch this version uses the new\ntls_*crypt_async_wait() helpers and converts the EBUSY to\nEINPROGRESS to avoid having to modify all the error handling\npaths.

While certain services operate within the confines of limited PCP user/group privileges, others are granted full root privileges. This disparity in privilege levels poses a risk when privileged root processes interact with directories or directory trees owned by unprivileged PCP users. Specifically, this vulnerability may lead to the compromise of PCP user isolation and facilitate local PCP-to-root exploits, particularly through symlink attacks. These vulnerabilities underscore the importance of maintaining robust privilege separation mechanisms within PCP to mitigate the potential for unauthorized privilege escalation."
