Exploitation of this vulnerability required access to the GitHub Enterprise Server instance and access to the Management Console with the editor role. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 3.12 and was fixed in versions 3.11.5, 3.10.7, 3.9.10, and 3.8.15. This vulnerability was reported via the  GitHub Bug Bounty program https://bounty.github.com .\n"

Only the new dentry is supposed to exist.\n\nGenerally this works correctly, however there is a scenario where this is\nnot currently working, because the old parent of the file/directory that\nwas moved is not authoritative for a range that includes the dir index and\ndir item keys of the old dentry. This case is better explained with the\nfollowing example and reproducer:\n\n  # The test requires a very specific layout of keys and items in the\n  # fs/subvolume btree to trigger the bug. So we want to make sure that\n  # on whatever platform we are, we have the same leaf/node size.\n  #\n  # Currently in btrfs the node/leaf size can not be smaller than the page\n  # size (but it can be greater than the page size). So use the largest\n  # supported node/leaf size (64K).\n\n  $ mkfs.btrfs -f -n 65536 /dev/sdc\n  $ mount /dev/sdc /mnt\n\n  # \"testdir\" is inode 257.\n  $ mkdir /mnt/testdir\n  $ chmod 755 /mnt/testdir\n\n  # Create several empty files to have the directory \"testdir\" with its\n  # items spread over several leaves (7 in this case).\n  $ for ((i = 1; i <= 1200; i++)); do\n       echo -n > /mnt/testdir/file$i\n    done\n\n  # Create our test directory \"dira\", inode number 1458, which gets all\n  # its items in leaf 7.\n  #\n  # The BTRFS_DIR_ITEM_KEY item for inode 257 (\"testdir\") that points to\n  # the entry named \"dira\" is in leaf 2, while the BTRFS_DIR_INDEX_KEY\n  # item that points to that entry is in leaf 3.\n  #\n  # For this particular filesystem node size (64K), file count and file\n  # names, we endup with the directory entry items from inode 257 in\n  # leaves 2 and 3, as previously mentioned - what matters for triggering\n  # the bug exercised by this test case is that those items are not placed\n  # in leaf 1, they must be placed in a leaf different from the one\n  # containing the inode item for inode 257.\n  #\n  # The corresponding BTRFS_DIR_ITEM_KEY and BTRFS_DIR_INDEX_KEY items for\n  # the parent inode (257) are the following:\n  #\n  #    item 460 key (257 DIR_ITEM 3724298081) itemoff 48344 itemsize 34\n  #         location key (1458 INODE_ITEM 0) type DIR\n  #         transid 6 data_len 0 name_len 4\n  #         name: dira\n  #\n  # and:\n  #\n  #    item 771 key (257 DIR_INDEX 1202) itemoff 36673 itemsize 34\n  #         location key (1458 INODE_ITEM 0) type DIR\n  #         transid 6 data_len 0 name_len 4\n  #         name: dira\n\n  $ mkdir /mnt/testdir/dira\n\n  # Make sure everything done so far is durably persisted.\n  $ sync\n\n  # Now do a change to inode 257 (\"testdir\") that does not result in\n  # COWing leaves 2 and 3 - the leaves that contain the directory items\n  # pointing to inode 1458 (directory \"dira\").\n  #\n  # Changing permissions, the owner/group, updating or adding a xattr,\n  # etc, will not change (COW) leaves 2 and 3. So for the sake of\n  # simplicity change the permissions of inode 257, which results in\n  # updating its inode item and therefore change (COW) only leaf 1.\n\n  $ chmod 700 /mnt/testdir\n\n  # Now fsync directory inode 257.\n  #\n  # Since only the first leaf was changed/COWed, we log the inode item of\n  # inode 257 and only the dentries found in the first leaf, all have a\n  # key type of BTRFS_DIR_ITEM_KEY, and no keys of type\n  # BTRFS_DIR_INDEX_KEY, because they sort after the former type and none\n  # exist in the first leaf.\n  #\n  # We also log 3 items that represent ranges for dir items and dir\n  # indexes for which the log is authoritative:\n  #\n  # 1) a key of type BTRFS_DIR_LOG_ITEM_KEY, which indicates the log is\n  #    authoritative for all BTRFS_DIR_ITEM_KEY keys that have an offset\n  #    in the range [0, 2285968570] (the offset here is th\n---truncated---"

The\nsender (do_mq_timedsend) uses this address to later call pipelined_send.\n\nThis leads to a very hard to trigger race where a do_mq_timedreceive\ncall might return and leave do_mq_timedsend to rely on an invalid\naddress, causing the following crash:\n\n  RIP: 0010:wake_q_add_safe+0x13/0x60\n  Call Trace:\n   __x64_sys_mq_timedsend+0x2a9/0x490\n   do_syscall_64+0x80/0x680\n   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xa9\n  RIP: 0033:0x7f5928e40343\n\nThe race occurs as:\n\n1. do_mq_timedreceive calls wq_sleep with the address of `struct\n   ext_wait_queue` on function stack (aliased as `ewq_addr` here) - it\n   holds a valid `struct ext_wait_queue *` as long as the stack has not\n   been overwritten.\n\n2. `ewq_addr` gets added to info->e_wait_q[RECV].list in wq_add, and\n   do_mq_timedsend receives it via wq_get_first_waiter(info, RECV) to call\n   __pipelined_op.\n\n3. Sender calls __pipelined_op::smp_store_release(&this->state,\n   STATE_READY).  Here is where the race window begins.  (`this` is\n   `ewq_addr`.)\n\n4. If the receiver wakes up now in do_mq_timedreceive::wq_sleep, it\n   will see `state == STATE_READY` and break.\n\n5. do_mq_timedreceive returns, and `ewq_addr` is no longer guaranteed\n   to be a `struct ext_wait_queue *` since it was on do_mq_timedreceive's\n   stack.  (Although the address may not get overwritten until another\n   function happens to touch it, which means it can persist around for an\n   indefinite time.)\n\n6. do_mq_timedsend::__pipelined_op() still believes `ewq_addr` is a\n   `struct ext_wait_queue *`, and uses it to find a task_struct to pass to\n   the wake_q_add_safe call.  In the lucky case where nothing has\n   overwritten `ewq_addr` yet, `ewq_addr->task` is the right task_struct.\n   In the unlucky case, __pipelined_op::wake_q_add_safe gets handed a\n   bogus address as the receiver's task_struct causing the crash.\n\ndo_mq_timedsend::__pipelined_op() should not dereference `this` after\nsetting STATE_READY, as the receiver counterpart is now free to return.\nChange __pipelined_op to call wake_q_add_safe on the receiver's\ntask_struct returned by get_task_struct, instead of dereferencing `this`\nwhich sits on the receiver's stack.\n\nAs Manfred pointed out, the race potentially also exists in\nipc/msg.c::expunge_all and ipc/sem.c::wake_up_sem_queue_prepare.

Juhyung reported\nthat EROFS data corruption can be found on a new Intel x86 processor.\nAfter some analysis, it seems that recent x86 processors with the new\nFSRM feature expose this issue with \"rep movsb\".\n\nLet's strictly use the decompressed buffer for lz4 inplace\ndecompression for now.

But fault_in_readable succeeds because buf +\nfx_sw->xstate_size is within the still mapped area, so it goes back and\ntries xrstor again. It will spin in this loop forever.\n\nInstead, fault in the maximum size which can be touched by XRSTOR (taken\nfrom fpstate->user_size).\n\n[ dhansen: tweak subject / changelog ]"
