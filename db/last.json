This happens because its_vpe_irq_domain_free() frees the\ninterrupts along with the area bitmap and the vprop_page and\nits_vpe_irq_domain_alloc() subsequently frees the area bitmap and the\nvprop_page again.\n\nFix this by unconditionally invoking its_vpe_irq_domain_free() which\nhandles all cases correctly and by removing the bitmap/vprop_page freeing\nfrom its_vpe_irq_domain_alloc().\n\n[ tglx: Massaged change log ]"

This function searches the list\nof all PCI devices until the desired device is found. To improve lookup\nefficiency, replace it with device_rbtree_find() to search the device\nwithin the probed device rbtree.\n\nThe I/O page fault is initiated by the device, which does not have any\nsynchronization mechanism with the software to ensure that the device\nstays in the probed device tree. Theoretically, a device could be released\nby the IOMMU subsystem after device_rbtree_find() and before\niopf_get_dev_fault_param(), which would cause a use-after-free problem.\n\nAdd a mutex to synchronize the I/O page fault reporting path and the IOMMU\nrelease device path. This lock doesn't introduce any performance overhead,\nas the conflict between I/O page fault reporting and device releasing is\nvery rare."

The arithmetic\nimplies adding together a 64-bit register with a int offset. The\nregister was checked to be below 1<<29 when it was variable, but not\nwhen it was fixed. The offset either comes from an instruction (in which\ncase it is 16 bit), from another register (in which case the caller\nchecked it to be below 1<<29 [1]), or from the size of an argument to a\nkfunc (in which case it can be a u32 [2]). Between the register being\ninconsistently checked to be below 1<<29, and the offset being up to an\nu32, it appears that we were open to overflowing the `int`s which were\ncurrently used for arithmetic.\n\n[1] https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/815fb87b753055df2d9e50f6cd80eb10235fe3e9/kernel/bpf/verifier.c#L7494-L7498\n[2] https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/815fb87b753055df2d9e50f6cd80eb10235fe3e9/kernel/bpf/verifier.c#L11904"

According to the UEFI spec,\nthis stack needs to be at least 128k in size - this might seem large but\nall asynchronous processing and event handling in EFI runs from the same\nstack and so quite a lot of space may be used in practice.\n\nIn mixed mode, the situation is a bit different: the bootloader calls\nthe 32-bit EFI stub entry point, which calls the decompressor's 32-bit\nentry point, where the boot stack is set up, using a fixed allocation\nof 16k. This stack is still in use when the EFI stub is started in\n64-bit mode, and so all calls back into the EFI firmware will be using\nthe decompressor's limited boot stack.\n\nDue to the placement of the boot stack right after the boot heap, any\nstack overruns have gone unnoticed. However, commit\n\n  5c4feadb0011983b (\"x86/decompressor: Move global symbol references to C code\")\n\nmoved the definition of the boot heap into C code, and now the boot\nstack is placed right at the base of BSS, where any overruns will\ncorrupt the end of the .data section.\n\nWhile it would be possible to work around this by increasing the size of\nthe boot stack, doing so would affect all x86 systems, and mixed mode\nsystems are a tiny (and shrinking) fraction of the x86 installed base.\n\nSo instead, record the firmware stack pointer value when entering from\nthe 32-bit firmware, and switch to this stack every time a EFI boot\nservice call is made."
