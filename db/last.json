It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the\nSMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called directly by\nend user applications.\n\nThe function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO_f_asn1 filter\nBIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of\nthe BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS\nrecipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed and the function\nreturns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain\nis not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains\ninternal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on\nto call BIO_pop() on the BIO then a use-after-free will occur. This will most\nlikely result in a crash.\n\n\n\nThis scenario occurs directly in the internal function B64_write_ASN1() which\nmay cause BIO_new_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call BIO_pop() on\nthe BIO. This internal function is in turn called by the public API functions\nPEM_write_bio_ASN1_stream, PEM_write_bio_CMS_stream, PEM_write_bio_PKCS7_stream,\nSMIME_write_ASN1, SMIME_write_CMS and SMIME_write_PKCS7.\n\nOther public API functions that may be impacted by this include\ni2d_ASN1_bio_stream, BIO_new_CMS, BIO_new_PKCS7, i2d_CMS_bio_stream and\ni2d_PKCS7_bio_stream.\n\nThe OpenSSL cms and smime command line applications are similarly affected.\n\n\n\n"

Using its HSTS support, curl can be instructed to use HTTPS instead of using an insecure clear-text HTTP step even when HTTP is provided in the URL. However, the HSTS mechanism could be bypassed if the host name in the given URL first uses IDN characters that get replaced to ASCII counterparts as part of the IDN conversion. Like using the character UTF-8 U+3002 (IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP) instead of the common ASCII full stop (U+002E) `.`. Then in a subsequent request, it does not detect the HSTS state and makes a clear text transfer. Because it would store the info IDN encoded but look for it IDN decoded."

This occurs because the mt19937 Mersenne Twister takes a single 32-bit value as an input seed, resulting in only four billion possible mnemonics. The affected versions of the browser extension are 0.0.172 through 0.0.182. To steal funds efficiently, an attacker can identify all Ethereum addresses created since the 0.0.172 release, and check whether they are Ethereum addresses that could have been created by this extension. To respond to the risk, affected users need to upgrade the product version and also move funds to a new wallet address."

This token remains valid even after the password reset and can be used a second time to change the password of the corresponding user. The token expires only 3 hours after issuance and is sent as a query parameter when resetting. An attacker with access to the browser history can thus use the token again to change the password in order to take over the account."
