Removing that locking from read_descriptors() exposed it to\nthe race.\n\nThe best way to fix the bug is to keep hub_port_init() from changing\nudev->descriptor once udev has been initialized and registered.\nDrivers expect the descriptors stored in the kernel to be immutable;\nwe should not undermine this expectation.  In fact, this change should\nhave been made long ago.\n\nSo now hub_port_init() will take an additional argument, specifying a\nbuffer in which to store the device descriptor it reads.  (If udev has\nnot yet been initialized, the buffer pointer will be NULL and then\nhub_port_init() will store the device descriptor in udev as before.)\nThis eliminates the data race responsible for the out-of-bounds read.\n\nThe changes to hub_port_init() appear more extensive than they really\nare, because of indentation changes resulting from an attempt to avoid\nwriting to other parts of the usb_device structure after it has been\ninitialized.  Similar changes should be made to the code that reads\nthe BOS descriptor, but that can be handled in a separate patch later\non.  This patch is sufficient to fix the bug found by syzbot."

        "summary": "CKAN is an open-source data management system for powering data hubs and data portals. There are a number of CKAN plugins, including XLoader, DataPusher, Resource proxy and ckanext-archiver, that work by downloading the contents of local or remote files in order to perform some actions with their contents (e.g. pushing to the DataStore, streaming contents or saving a local copy). All of them use the resource URL, and there are currently no checks to limit what URLs can be requested. This means that a malicious (or unaware) user can create a resource with a URL pointing to a place where they should not have access in order for one of the previous tools to retrieve it (known as a Server Side Request Forgery). Users wanting to protect against these kinds of attacks can use one or a combination of the following approaches: (1) Use a separate HTTP proxy like Squid that can be used to allow / disallow IPs, domains etc as needed, and make CKAN extensions aware of this setting via the ckan.download_proxy config option. (2) Implement custom firewall rules to prevent access to restricted resources. (3) Use custom validators on the resource url field to block/allow certain domains or IPs. All latest versions of the plugins listed above support the ckan.download_proxy settings. Support for this setting in the Resource Proxy plugin was included in CKAN 2.10.5 and 2.11.0."

The vulnerability allowed a reflected XSS attack by exploiting a flaw in the GeSHi syntax highlighter library hosted by the victim. The GeSHi library was included as a vendor dependency in CKEditor 4 source files. In a specific scenario, an attacker could craft a malicious script that could be executed by sending a request to the GeSHi library hosted on a PHP web server. The GeSHi library is no longer actively maintained. Due to the lack of ongoing support and updates, potential security vulnerabilities have been identified with its continued use. To mitigate these risks and enhance the overall security of the CKEditor 4, we have decided to completely remove the GeSHi library as a dependency. This change aims to maintain a secure environment and reduce the risk of any security incidents related to outdated or unsupported software. The fix is be available in version 4.25.0-lts."
