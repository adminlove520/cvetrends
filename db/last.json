        "summary": "Home assistant is an open source home automation. The Home Assistant login page allows users to use their local Home Assistant credentials and log in to another website that specifies the `redirect_uri` and `client_id` parameters. Although the `redirect_uri` validation typically ensures that it matches the `client_id` and the scheme represents either `http` or `https`, Home Assistant will fetch the `client_id` and check for `<link rel=\"redirect_uri\" href=\"...\">` HTML tags on the page. These URLs are not subjected to the same scheme validation and thus allow for arbitrary JavaScript execution on the Home Assistant administration page via usage of `javascript:` scheme URIs. This Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability can be executed on the Home Assistant frontend domain, which may be used for a full takeover of the Home Assistant account and installation. This issue has been addressed in version 2023.9.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."

        "summary": "Home assistant is an open source home automation. Whilst auditing the frontend code to identify hidden parameters, Cure53 detected `auth_callback=1`, which is leveraged by the WebSocket authentication logic in tandem with the `state` parameter. The state parameter contains the `hassUrl`, which is subsequently utilized to establish a WebSocket connection. This behavior permits an attacker to create a malicious Home Assistant link with a modified state parameter that forces the frontend to connect to an alternative WebSocket backend. Henceforth, the attacker can spoof any WebSocket responses and trigger cross site scripting (XSS). Since the XSS is executed on the actual Home Assistant frontend domain, it can connect to the real Home Assistant backend, which essentially represents a comprehensive takeover scenario. Permitting the site to be iframed by other origins, as discussed in GHSA-935v-rmg9-44mw, renders this exploit substantially covert since a malicious website can obfuscate the compromise strategy in the background. However, even without this, the attacker can still send the `auth_callback` link directly to the victim user. To mitigate this issue, Cure53 advises modifying the WebSocket code\u2019s authentication flow. An optimal implementation in this regard would not trust the `hassUrl` passed in by a GET parameter. Cure53 must stipulate the significant time required of the Cure53 consultants to identify an XSS vector, despite holding full control over the WebSocket responses. In many areas, data from the WebSocket was properly sanitized, which hinders post-exploitation. The audit team eventually detected the `js_url` for custom panels, though generally, the frontend exhibited reasonable security hardening. This issue has been addressed in Home Assistant Core version 2023.8.0 and in the npm package home-assistant-js-websocket in version 8.2.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."

The impact is potentially severe if you are logged in to the ArchiveBox admin site in the same browser session and view an archived malicious page designed to target your ArchiveBox instance. Malicious Javascript could potentially act using your logged-in admin credentials and add/remove/modify snapshots, add/remove/modify ArchiveBox users, and generally do anything an admin user could do. The impact is less severe for non-logged-in users, as malicious Javascript cannot *modify* any archives, but it can still *read* all the other archived content by fetching the snapshot index and iterating through it. Because all of ArchiveBox's archived content is served from the same host and port as the admin panel, when archived pages are viewed the JS executes in the same context as all the other archived pages (and the admin panel), defeating most of the browser's usual CORS/CSRF security protections and leading to this issue. A patch is being developed in https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/issues/239. As a mitigation for this issue would be to disable the wget extractor by setting `archivebox config --set SAVE_WGET=False`, ensure you are always logged out, or serve only a [static HTML version](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/wiki/Publishing-Your-Archive#2-export-and-host-it-as-static-html) of your archive."

When a carefully-crafted HTML snippet passes the XSS sanitisation layer, it is manipulated as a string by internal trimming functions before being stored in the undo stack. If the HTML snippet is restored from the undo stack, the combination of the string manipulation and reparative parsing by either the browser's native [DOMParser API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMParser) (TinyMCE 6) or the SaxParser API (TinyMCE 5) mutates the HTML maliciously, allowing an XSS payload to be executed. This vulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE 5.10.8 and TinyMCE 6.7.1 by ensuring HTML is trimmed using node-level manipulation instead of string manipulation. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."

The vulnerability exploits TinyMCE's unfiltered notification system, which is used in error handling. The conditions for this exploit requires carefully crafted malicious content to have been inserted into the editor and a notification to have been triggered. When a notification was opened, the HTML within the text argument was displayed unfiltered in the notification. The vulnerability allowed arbitrary JavaScript execution when an notification presented in the TinyMCE UI for the current user.  This issue could also be exploited by any integration which uses a TinyMCE notification to display unfiltered HTML content.

Artifact Hub allows providing some Docker credentials that are used to increase the rate limit applied when interacting with the Docker Hub registry API to read publicly available content. Due to the incorrect check described above, it'd be possible to hijack those credentials by purchasing a domain which ends with `docker.io` and deploying a fake OCI registry on it. <https://artifacthub.io/> uses some credentials that only have permissions to read public content available in the Docker Hub. However, even though credentials for private repositories (disabled on `artifacthub.io`) are handled in a different way, other Artifact Hub deployments could have been using them for a different purpose.

(For example, Windows uses these PCR measurements to determine device health.) A vulnerable device can masquerade as a healthy device by extending arbitrary values into Platform Configuration Register (PCR) banks. This requires physical access to a target victim's device, or compromise of user credentials for a device. This issue is similar to CVE-2021-42299 (on Surface Pro devices)."

Since ydb-go-sdk v3.48.6 if you use a custom credentials object (implementation of interface Credentials it may leak into logs. This happens because this object could be serialized into an error message using `fmt.Errorf(\"something went wrong (credentials: %q)\", credentials)` during connection to the YDB server. If such logging occurred, a  malicious user with access to logs could read sensitive information (i.e. credentials) information and use it to get access to the database. ydb-go-sdk contains this problem in versions from v3.48.6 to v3.53.2. The fix for this problem has been released in version v3.53.3. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should implement the `fmt.Stringer` interface in your custom credentials type with explicit stringify of object state."
