Since affected quic-go versions used IP_PMTUDISC_DO, the kernel would then return a \"message too large\" error on sendmsg, i.e. when quic-go attempts to send a packet that exceeds the MTU claimed in that ICMP packet. By setting this value to smaller than 1200 bytes (the minimum MTU for QUIC), the attacker can disrupt a QUIC connection. Crucially, this can be done after completion of the handshake, thereby circumventing any TCP fallback that might be implemented on the application layer (for example, many browsers fall back to HTTP over TCP if they're unable to establish a QUIC connection). The attacker needs to at least know the client's IP and port tuple to mount an attack. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.48.2."

No authentication is performed by the Server itself on `client` tokens. Authentication & authorization is instead delegated to the k8s API server. However, the Workflow Archive does not interact with k8s, and so any token that looks valid will be considered authenticated, even if it is not a k8s token or even if the token has no RBAC for Argo. To handle the lack of pass-through k8s authN/authZ, the Workflow Archive specifically does the equivalent of a `kubectl auth can-i` check for respective methods. In 3.5.7 and 3.5.8, the auth check was accidentally removed on the GET Workflow endpoint's fallback to archived workflows on these lines, allowing archived workflows to be retrieved with a fake token. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.6.2 and 3.5.13."

When parsing form data, python-multipart skips line breaks (CR \\r or LF \\n) in front of the first boundary and any tailing bytes after the last boundary. This happens one byte at a time and emits a log event each time, which may cause excessive logging for certain inputs. An attacker could abuse this by sending a malicious request with lots of data before the first or after the last boundary, causing high CPU load and stalling the processing thread for a significant amount of time. In case of ASGI application, this could stall the event loop and prevent other requests from being processed, resulting in a denial of service (DoS). This vulnerability is fixed in 0.0.18."

        "summary": "The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.
