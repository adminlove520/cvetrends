Unfortunately, when doing so it also invokes `free()` on a 4 byte localstack buffer.  Most modern malloc implementations detect this error and immediately abort. Some however accept the input pointer and add that memory to its list of available chunks. This leads to the overwriting of nearby stack memory. The content of the overwrite is decided by the `free()` implementation; likely to be memory pointers and a set of flags.  The most likely outcome of exploting this flaw is a crash, although it cannot be ruled out that more serious results can be had in special circumstances."

        "summary": "Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Argo CD has a Web-based terminal that allows users to get a shell inside a running pod, just as they would with kubectl exec. Starting in version 2.6.0, when the administrator enables this function and grants permission to the user `p, role:myrole, exec, create, */*, allow`, even if the user revokes this permission, the user can still perform operations in the container, as long as the user keeps the terminal view open for a long time. Although the token expiration and revocation of the user are fixed, however, the fix does not address the situation of revocation of only user `p, role:myrole, exec, create, */*, allow` permissions, which may still lead to the leakage of sensitive information. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions 2.11.7, 2.10.16, and 2.9.21."

In versions 15.0.3 and prior, the `getCustomLoginUrlTemplate` method in RealmOAuth2ProviderSettings.java is vulnerable to template injection due to its usage of user input. Although the developer intended to implement a custom URL for handling login to override the default PingOne Advanced Identity Cloud login page,they did not restrict the `CustomLoginUrlTemplate`, allowing it to be set freely. Commit fcb8432aa77d5b2e147624fe954cb150c568e0b8 introduces `TemplateClassResolver.SAFER_RESOLVER` to disable the resolution of commonly exploited classes in FreeMarker template injection. As of time of publication, this fix is expected to be part of version 15.0.4."

        "summary": "DuckDB is a SQL database management system. In versions 1.0.0 and prior, content in filesystem is accessible for reading using `sniff_csv`, even with `enable_external_access=false`. This vulnerability provides an attacker with access to filesystem even when access is expected to be disabled and other similar functions do NOT provide access. There seem to be two vectors to this vulnerability. First, access to files that should otherwise not be allowed. Second, the content from a file can be read (e.g. `/etc/hosts`, `proc/self/environ`, etc) even though that doesn't seem to be the intent of the sniff_csv function. A fix for this issue is available in commit c9b7c98aa0e1cd7363fe8bb8543a95f38e980d8a and is expected to be part of version 1.1.0."

A security vulnerability has been detected in certain versions of Docker Engine, which could allow an attacker to bypass authorization plugins (AuthZ) under specific circumstances. The base likelihood of this being exploited is low.\n\nUsing a specially-crafted API request, an Engine API client could make the daemon forward the request or response to an authorization plugin without the body. In certain circumstances, the authorization plugin may allow a request which it would have otherwise denied if the body had been forwarded to it.\n\nA security issue was discovered In 2018, where an attacker could bypass AuthZ plugins using a specially crafted API request. This could lead to unauthorized actions, including privilege escalation. Although this issue was fixed in Docker Engine v18.09.1 in January 2019, the fix was not carried forward to later major versions, resulting in a regression. Anyone who depends on authorization plugins that introspect the request and/or response body to make access control decisions is potentially impacted.\n\nDocker EE v19.03.x and all versions of Mirantis Container Runtime are not vulnerable.\n\ndocker-ce v27.1.1 containes patches to fix the vulnerability. Patches have also been merged into the master, 19.0, 20.0, 23.0, 24.0, 25.0, 26.0, and 26.1 release branches. If one is unable to upgrade immediately, avoid using AuthZ plugins and/or restrict access to the Docker API to trusted parties, following the principle of least privilege."
