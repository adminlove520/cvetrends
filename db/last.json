Previously, the struct had a fixed-length array of\nsize MAX_BSETS which was indexed out-of-bounds for the dynamically-sized\niterators, which causes UBSAN to complain.\n\nThis patch uses the same approach as in bcachefs's sort_iter and splits\nthe iterator into a btree_iter with a flexible array member and a\nbtree_iter_stack which embeds a btree_iter as well as a fixed-length\ndata array."

        "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: gadget: f_fs: Fix race between aio_cancel() and AIO request complete\n\nFFS based applications can utilize the aio_cancel() callback to dequeue\npending USB requests submitted to the UDC.  There is a scenario where the\nFFS application issues an AIO cancel call, while the UDC is handling a\nsoft disconnect.  For a DWC3 based implementation, the callstack looks\nlike the following:\n\n    DWC3 Gadget                               FFS Application\ndwc3_gadget_soft_disconnect()              ...\n  --> dwc3_stop_active_transfers()\n    --> dwc3_gadget_giveback(-ESHUTDOWN)\n      --> ffs_epfile_async_io_complete()   ffs_aio_cancel()\n        --> usb_ep_free_request()            --> usb_ep_dequeue()\n\nThere is currently no locking implemented between the AIO completion\nhandler and AIO cancel, so the issue occurs if the completion routine is\nrunning in parallel to an AIO cancel call coming from the FFS application.\nAs the completion call frees the USB request (io_data->req) the FFS\napplication is also referencing it for the usb_ep_dequeue() call.  This can\nlead to accessing a stale/hanging pointer.\n\ncommit b566d38857fc (\"usb: gadget: f_fs: use io_data->status consistently\")\nrelocated the usb_ep_free_request() into ffs_epfile_async_io_complete().\nHowever, in order to properly implement locking to mitigate this issue, the\nspinlock can't be added to ffs_epfile_async_io_complete(), as\nusb_ep_dequeue() (if successfully dequeuing a USB request) will call the\nfunction driver's completion handler in the same context.  Hence, leading\ninto a deadlock.\n\nFix this issue by moving the usb_ep_free_request() back to\nffs_user_copy_worker(), and ensuring that it explicitly sets io_data->req\nto NULL after freeing it within the ffs->eps_lock.  This resolves the race\ncondition above, as the ffs_aio_cancel() routine will not continue\nattempting to dequeue a request that has already been freed, or the\nffs_user_copy_work() not freeing the USB request until the AIO cancel is\ndone referencing it.\n\nThis fix depends on\n  commit b566d38857fc (\"usb: gadget: f_fs: use io_data->status\n  consistently\")"

KVM's ABI for NMIs that arrive simultanesouly (from KVM's point of\nview) is to inject one NMI and pend the other.  When using vNMI, KVM pends\nthe second NMI simply by setting V_NMI_PENDING, and lets the CPU do the\nrest (hardware automatically sets V_NMI_BLOCKING when an NMI is injected).\n\nHowever, if KVM can't immediately inject an NMI, e.g. because the vCPU is\nin an STI shadow or is running with GIF=0, then KVM will request an NMI\nwindow and trigger the WARN (but still function correctly).\n\nWhether or not the GIF=0 case makes sense is debatable, as the intent of\nKVM's behavior is to provide functionality that is as close to real\nhardware as possible.  E.g. if two NMIs are sent in quick succession, the\nprobability of both NMIs arriving in an STI shadow is infinitesimally low\non real hardware, but significantly larger in a virtual environment, e.g.\nif the vCPU is preempted in the STI shadow.  For GIF=0, the argument isn't\nas clear cut, because the window where two NMIs can collide is much larger\nin bare metal (though still small).\n\nThat said, KVM should not have divergent behavior for the GIF=0 case based\non whether or not vNMI support is enabled.  And KVM has allowed\nsimultaneous NMIs with GIF=0 for over a decade, since commit 7460fb4a3400\n(\"KVM: Fix simultaneous NMIs\").  I.e. KVM's GIF=0 handling shouldn't be\nmodified without a *really* good reason to do so, and if KVM's behavior\nwere to be modified, it should be done irrespective of vNMI support."
