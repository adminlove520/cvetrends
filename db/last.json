Since this value is controlled by external entities, a malicious Matrix homeserver joined to a room in which a matrix-appservice-irc bridge instance (before version 2.0.1) is present can fabricate the timestamp with the intent of tricking the bridge into leaking room messages the homeserver should not have access to. matrix-appservice-irc 2.0.1 drops the reliance on `origin_server_ts` when determining whether or not an event should be visible to a user, instead tracking the event timestamps internally. As a workaround, it's possible to limit the amount of information leaked by setting a reply template that doesn't contain the original message."

The real existence of this vulnerability is still doubted at the moment. The patch is identified as 0c394a795b9c10c07085361e6fcea286ee793701. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. VDB-257782 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer. NOTE: The issue, discovered in a 20-stars GitHub project (now private) by its author, had CVE requested by a third party 4 years post-resolution, referencing the fix commit (now a broken link). Due to minimal attention and usage, it should not be eligible for CVE according to the project maintainer."
