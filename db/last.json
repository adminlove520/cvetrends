Digging deeper into the issue we\nsee that the deletion order is such that the ACPI devices matching the\nmux channel i2c adapters are deleted first during the SSDT overlay\nremoval. For each of the channels we see a call to i2c_acpi_notify()\nwith ACPI_RECONFIG_DEVICE_REMOVE but, because these devices are not\nactually i2c_clients, nothing is done for them.\n\nLater on, after each of the mux channels has been dealt with, we come\nto delete the i2c_client representing the PCA9548 device. This is the\ncall stack we see above, whereby the kernel cleans up the i2c_client\nincluding destruction of the mux and its channel adapters. At this\npoint we do attempt to unbind from the ACPI peers but those peers \n---truncated---"
