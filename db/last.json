This issue can\nbe reproduced by running the following from libkcapi:\n\n    kcapi-rng -b 9000000 > OUTFILE\n\nThe generated OUTFILE will have three huge sections that contain all\nzeros, and this is caused by the code where the test\n'val & PRNG_STATUS_DATA_AVAIL' fails.\n\nLet's fix this issue by ensuring that qcom_rng_read() always returns\nwith a full buffer if the function returns success.
