Landlock only implements the\ncred_prepare hook, not cred_transfer, so KEYCTL_SESSION_TO_PARENT causes\nall information on Landlock restrictions to be lost.\n\nThis basically means that a process with the ability to use the fork()\nand keyctl() syscalls can get rid of all Landlock restrictions on\nitself.\n\nFix it by adding a cred_transfer hook that does the same thing as the\nexisting cred_prepare hook. (Implemented by having hook_cred_prepare()\ncall hook_cred_transfer() so that the two functions are less likely to\naccidentally diverge in the future.)"

When the gts->itime_table[i].time_us is zero, e.g., the time\nsequence is `3, 0, 1`, the inner for-loop will not terminate and do\nout-of-bound writes. This is because once `times[j] > new`, the value\n`new` will be added in the current position and the `times[j]` will be\nmoved to `j+1` position, which makes the if-condition always hold.\nMeanwhile, idx will be added one, making the loop keep running without\ntermination and out-of-bound write.\n2.

But this will lead to `libbpf_probe_bpf_prog_type`\nAPI broken which use verifier log to probe prog type and will log\nnothing if we reject invalid EXT prog before bpf_check().\n\nAnother way is by adding null check in resolve_prog_type().\n\nThe issue was introduced by commit 4a9c7bbe2ed4 (\"bpf: Resolve to\nprog->aux->dst_prog->type only for BPF_PROG_TYPE_EXT\") which wanted\nto correct type resolution for BPF_PROG_TYPE_TRACING programs. Before\nthat, the type resolution of BPF_PROG_TYPE_EXT prog actually follows\nthe logic below:\n\n  prog->aux->dst_prog ? prog->aux->dst_prog->type : prog->type;\n\nIt implies that when EXT program is not yet attached to `dst_prog`,\nthe prog type should be EXT itself. This code worked fine in the past.\nSo just keep using it.\n\nFix this by returning `prog->type` for BPF_PROG_TYPE_EXT if `dst_prog`\nis not present in resolve_prog_type()."

In cgroup v1, the mount operation will\nallocate cgroup_root, and top_cpuset.css.cgrp will point to the allocated\n&cgroup_root.cgrp. When the umount operation is executed,\ntop_cpuset.css.cgrp will be rebound to &cgrp_dfl_root.cgrp.\n\nThe problem is that when rebinding to cgrp_dfl_root, there are cases\nwhere the cgroup_root allocated by setting up the root for cgroup v1\nis cached. This could lead to a Use-After-Free (UAF) if it is\nsubsequently freed. The descendant cgroups of cgroup v1 can only be\nfreed after the css is released. However, the css of the root will never\nbe released, yet the cgroup_root should be freed when it is unmounted.\nThis means that obtaining a reference to the css of the root does\nnot guarantee that css.cgrp->root will not be freed.\n\nFix this problem by using rcu_read_lock in proc_cpuset_show().\nAs cgroup_root is kfree_rcu after commit d23b5c577715\n(\"cgroup: Make operations on the cgroup root_list RCU safe\"),\ncss->cgroup won't be freed during the critical section.\nTo call cgroup_path_ns_locked, css_set_lock is needed, so it is safe to\nreplace task_get_css with task_css.\n\n[1] https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=9b1ff7be974a403aa4cd"
