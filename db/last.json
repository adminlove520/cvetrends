By design, `cookie` headers are forbidden request headers, disallowing them to be set in RequestInit.headers in browser environments. Since undici handles headers more liberally than the spec, there was a disconnect from the assumptions the spec made, and undici's implementation of fetch. As such this may lead to accidental leakage of cookie to a third-party site or a malicious attacker who can control the redirection target (ie. an open redirector) to leak the cookie to the third party site. This was patched in version 5.26.2. There are no known workarounds."

Continued receipt and processing of telemetry requests will repeatedly crash the jkdsd process and sustain the Denial of Service (DoS) condition.\n\nThis issue is seen on all Junos platforms. The crash is triggered when multiple telemetry requests come from different collectors. As the load increases, the Dynamic Rendering Daemon (drend) decides to defer processing and continue later, which results in a timing issue accessing stale memory, causing the jkdsd process to crash and restart.\n\nNote: jkdsd is not shipped with SRX Series devices and therefore are not affected by this vulnerability.\nThis issue affects:\n\nJuniper Networks Junos OS:\n\n\n\n  *  20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S9;\n  *  21.1 versions 21.1R1 and later;\n  *  21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S6;\n  *  21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-S5;\n  *  21.4 versions prior to 21.4R3-S5;\n  *  22.1 versions prior to 22.1R3-S4;\n  *  22.2 versions prior to 22.2R3-S2;\n  *  22.3 versions prior to 22.3R2-S1, 22.3R3-S1;\n  *  22.4 versions prior to 22.4R2-S2, 22.4R3;\n  *  23.1 versions prior to 23.1R2;\n  *  23.2 versions prior to 23.2R2.\n\n\n\n\nThis issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS versions prior to 19.4R1.\n\n\n\n"

Prior to era-compiler-vype version 1.3.10, a bug prevented the initialization of the first immutable variable for Vyper contracts meeting certain criteria. The problem arises when there is a String or Array with more 256-bit words allocated than initialized. It results in the second word\u2019s index unset, that is effectively set to 0, so the first immutable value with the actual 0 index is overwritten in the ImmutableSimulator. Version 1.3.10 fixes this issue by setting all indexes in advance. The problem will go away, but it will get more expensive if the user allocates a lot of uninitialized space, e.g. `String[4096]`. Upgrading and redeploying affected contracts is the only way of working around the issue.\n"

When trying to create a document that already exists, XWiki displays an error message in the form for creating it. Due to missing escaping, this error message is vulnerable to raw HTML injection and thus XSS. The injected code is the document reference of the existing document so this requires that the attacker first creates a non-empty document whose name contains the attack code. This has been patched in `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web` version 13.4-rc-1 and `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web-templates` versions 14.10.12 and 15.5-rc-1 by adding the appropriate escaping.
