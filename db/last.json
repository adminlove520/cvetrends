        "summary": "Oppia is an online learning platform. When comparing a received CSRF token against the expected token, Oppia uses the string equality operator (`==`), which is not safe against timing attacks. By repeatedly submitting invalid tokens, an attacker can brute-force the expected CSRF token character by character. Once they have recovered the token, they can then submit a forged request on behalf of a logged-in user and execute privileged actions on that user's behalf. In particular the function to validate received CSRF tokens is at `oppia.core.controllers.base.CsrfTokenManager.is_csrf_token_valid`. An attacker who can lure a logged-in Oppia user to a malicious website can perform any change on Oppia that the user is authorized to do, including changing profile information; creating, deleting, and changing explorations; etc. Note that the attacker cannot change a user's login credentials. An attack would need to complete within 1 second because every second, the time used in computing the token changes. This issue has been addressed in commit `b89bf80837` which has been included in release `3.3.2-hotfix-2`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."

Flarum is affected by a vulnerability that allows an attacker to conduct a Blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack or disclose any file on the server, even with a basic user account on any Flarum forum. By uploading a file containing a URL and spoofing the MIME type, an attacker can manipulate the application to execute unintended actions. The vulnerability is due to the behavior of the `intervention/image` package, which attempts to interpret the supplied file contents as a URL, which then fetches its contents. This allows an attacker to exploit the vulnerability to perform SSRF attacks, disclose local file contents, or conduct a blind oracle attack. This has been patched in Flarum version 1.8.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may disable PHP's `allow_url_fopen` which will prevent the fetching of external files via URLs as a temporary workaround for the SSRF aspect of the vulnerability."

Versions of uthenticode prior to the 2.x series did not check Extended Key Usages in certificates, in violation of the Authenticode X.509 certificate profile. As a result, a malicious user could produce a \"signed\" PE file that uthenticode would verify and consider valid using an X.509 certificate that isn't entitled to produce code signatures (e.g., a SSL certificate). By design, uthenticode does not perform full-chain validation. However, the absence of EKU validation was an unintended oversight. The 2.0.0 release series includes EKU checks. There are no workarounds to this vulnerability."
