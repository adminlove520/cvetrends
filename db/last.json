During internal penetration testing of a product based on Yii2, users discovered a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the framework itself. This issue is relevant for the latest version of Yii2 (2.0.49.3). This issue lies in the mechanism for displaying function argument values in the stack trace. The vulnerability manifests when an argument's value exceeds 32 characters. For convenience, argument values exceeding this limit are truncated and displayed with an added \"...\". The full argument value becomes visible when hovering over it with the mouse, as it is displayed in the title attribute of a span tag. However, the use of a double quote (\") allows an attacker to break out of the title attribute's value context and inject their own attributes into the span tag, including malicious JavaScript code through event handlers such as onmousemove. This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the security context of the victim's site via a specially crafted link. This could lead to the theft of cookies (including httpOnly cookies, which are accessible on the page), content substitution, or complete takeover of user accounts. This issue has been addressed in version 2.0.50. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."

The Fides webserver has a number of endpoints that retrieve `ConnectionConfiguration` records and their associated `secrets` which _can_ contain sensitive data (e.g. passwords, private keys, etc.). These `secrets` are stored encrypted at rest (in the application database), and the associated endpoints are not meant to expose that sensitive data in plaintext to API clients, as it could be compromising. Fides's developers have available to them a Pydantic field-attribute (`sensitive`) that they can annotate as `True` to indicate that a given secret field should not be exposed via the API. The application has an internal function that uses `sensitive` annotations to mask the sensitive fields with a `\"**********\"` placeholder value. This vulnerability is due to a bug in that function, which prevented `sensitive` API model fields that were _nested_ below the root-level of a `secrets` object from being masked appropriately. Only the `BigQuery` connection configuration secrets meets these criteria: the secrets schema has a nested sensitive `keyfile_creds.private_key` property that is exposed in plaintext via the APIs. Connection types other than `BigQuery` with sensitive fields at the root-level that are not nested are properly masked with the placeholder and are not affected by this vulnerability. This vulnerability has been patched in Fides version 2.37.0. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat. Users are also advised to rotate any Google Cloud secrets used for BigQuery integrations in their Fides deployments. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."

        "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: zoned: do not flag ZEROOUT on non-dirty extent buffer\n\nBtrfs clears the content of an extent buffer marked as\nEXTENT_BUFFER_ZONED_ZEROOUT before the bio submission. This mechanism is\nintroduced to prevent a write hole of an extent buffer, which is once\nallocated, marked dirty, but turns out unnecessary and cleaned up within\none transaction operation.\n\nCurrently, btrfs_clear_buffer_dirty() marks the extent buffer as\nEXTENT_BUFFER_ZONED_ZEROOUT, and skips the entry function. If this call\nhappens while the buffer is under IO (with the WRITEBACK flag set,\nwithout the DIRTY flag), we can add the ZEROOUT flag and clear the\nbuffer's content just before a bio submission. As a result:\n\n1) it can lead to adding faulty delayed reference item which leads to a\n   FS corrupted (EUCLEAN) error, and\n\n2) it writes out cleared tree node on disk\n\nThe former issue is previously discussed in [1]. The corruption happens\nwhen it runs a delayed reference update. So, on-disk data is safe.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-btrfs/3f4f2a0ff1a6c818050434288925bdcf3cd719e5.1709124777.git.naohiro.aota@wdc.com/\n\nThe latter one can reach on-disk data. But, as that node is already\nprocessed by btrfs_clear_buffer_dirty(), that will be invalidated in the\nnext transaction commit anyway. So, the chance of hitting the corruption\nis relatively small.\n\nAnyway, we should skip flagging ZEROOUT on a non-DIRTY extent buffer, to\nkeep the content under IO intact."

        "summary": "A code injection vulnerability exists in the huggingface/text-generation-inference repository, specifically within the `autodocs.yml` workflow file. The vulnerability arises from the insecure handling of the `github.head_ref` user input, which is used to dynamically construct a command for installing a software package. An attacker can exploit this by forking the repository, creating a branch with a malicious payload as the name, and then opening a pull request to the base repository. Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the GitHub Actions runner. This issue affects versions up to and including v2.0.0 and was fixed in version 2.0.0."

        "summary": "A path traversal vulnerability was identified in the parisneo/lollms-webui repository, specifically within version 9.6. The vulnerability arises due to improper handling of user-supplied input in the 'list_personalities' endpoint. By crafting a malicious HTTP request, an attacker can traverse the directory structure and view the contents of any folder, albeit limited to subfolder names only. This issue was demonstrated via a specific HTTP request that manipulated the 'category' parameter to access arbitrary directories. The vulnerability is present in the code located at the 'endpoints/lollms_advanced.py' file."

Additionally, one of the GPIO\nchip's lines is also in the release process and holds the notifier chain's\nread rwsem. Consequently, a race condition leads to the use-after-free of\nwatched_lines.\n\nHere is the typical stack when issue happened:\n\n[free]\ngpio_chrdev_release()\n  --> bitmap_free(cdev->watched_lines)                  <-- freed\n  --> blocking_notifier_chain_unregister()\n    --> down_write(&nh->rwsem)                          <-- waiting rwsem\n          --> __down_write_common()\n            --> rwsem_down_write_slowpath()\n                  --> schedule_preempt_disabled()\n                    --> schedule()\n\n[use]\nst54spi_gpio_dev_release()\n  --> gpio_free()\n    --> gpiod_free()\n      --> gpiod_free_commit()\n        --> gpiod_line_state_notify()\n          --> blocking_notifier_call_chain()\n            --> down_read(&nh->rwsem);                  <-- held rwsem\n            --> notifier_call_chain()\n              --> lineinfo_changed_notify()\n                --> test_bit(xxxx, cdev->watched_lines) <-- use after free\n\nThe side effect of the use-after-free issue is that a GPIO line event is\nbeing generated for userspace where it shouldn't.

If the mptcp worker (dumbly) tries mptcp-level\nre-injection after such ack, that would unconditionally trigger a send\nbuffer cleanup using 'bad' snd_una values.\n\nWe could easily disable re-injection for fallback sockets, but such\ndumb behavior already helped catching a few subtle issues and a very\nlow to zero impact in practice.\n\nInstead address the issue always initializing snd_nxt (and write_seq,\nfor consistency) at connect time."
