An SQL Injection issue was identified in the Divido payment extension for OpenCart, which is included by default in version 3.0.3.9. As an anonymous unauthenticated user, if the Divido payment module is installed (it does not have to be enabled), it is possible to exploit SQL injection to gain unauthorised access to the backend database. For any site which is vulnerable, any unauthenticated user could exploit this to dump the entire OpenCart database, including customer PII data."

The length of this\nstring without the %s is 16 characters. The warning message indicated\nthat 'chip_name' could be up to 29 characters long, resulting in a total\nof 45 characters, which exceeds the buffer size of 30 characters.\n\nTo resolve this issue, the size of the 'ucode_prefix' buffer has been\nreduced from 30 to 15.
