        "summary": "libuv is a multi-platform support library with a focus on asynchronous I/O. The `uv_getaddrinfo` function in `src/unix/getaddrinfo.c` (and its windows counterpart `src/win/getaddrinfo.c`), truncates hostnames to 256 characters before calling `getaddrinfo`. This behavior can be exploited to create addresses like `0x00007f000001`, which are considered valid by `getaddrinfo` and could allow an attacker to craft payloads that resolve to unintended IP addresses, bypassing developer checks. The vulnerability arises due to how the `hostname_ascii` variable (with a length of 256 bytes) is handled in `uv_getaddrinfo` and subsequently in `uv__idna_toascii`. When the hostname exceeds 256 characters, it gets truncated without a terminating null byte. As a result attackers may be able to access internal APIs or for websites (similar to MySpace) that allows users to have `username.example.com` pages. Internal services that crawl or cache these user pages can be exposed to SSRF attacks if a malicious user chooses a long vulnerable username. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.48.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."

While certain services operate within the confines of limited PCP user/group privileges, others are granted full root privileges. This disparity in privilege levels poses a risk when privileged root processes interact with directories or directory trees owned by unprivileged PCP users. Specifically, this vulnerability may lead to the compromise of PCP user isolation and facilitate local PCP-to-root exploits, particularly through symlink attacks. These vulnerabilities underscore the importance of maintaining robust privilege separation mechanisms within PCP to mitigate the potential for unauthorized privilege escalation."

Thus when dwc->gadget is freed,\nthe first dwc3_ep in the list now has a dangling prev pointer and\nlikewise for the next pointer of the dwc3_ep at the tail of the list.\nThe dwc3_gadget_free_endpoints() that follows will result in a\nuse-after-free when it calls list_del().\n\nThis was caught by enabling KASAN and performing a driver unbind.\nThe recent commit 568262bf5492 (\"usb: dwc3: core: Add shutdown\ncallback for dwc3\") also exposes this as a panic during shutdown.\n\nThere are a few possibilities to fix this.  One could be to perform\na list_del() of the gadget->ep_list itself which removes it from\nthe rest of the dwc3_ep chain.\n\nAnother approach is what this patch does, by splitting up the\nusb_del_gadget_udc() call into its separate \"del\" and \"put\"\ncomponents.  This allows dwc3_gadget_free_endpoints() to be\ncalled before the gadget is finally freed with usb_put_gadget()."

In case the\nfirst extent record in catalog file gets full, new ones are allocated from\nextents overflow file.\n\nIn case shrinking truncate happens to middle of an extent record which\nlocates in extents overflow file, the logic in hfsplus_file_truncate() was\nchanged so that call to hfs_brec_remove() is not guarded any more.\n\nRight action would be just freeing the extents that exceed the new size\ninside extent record by calling hfsplus_free_extents(), and then check if\nthe whole extent record should be removed.  However since the guard\n(blk_cnt > start) is now after the call to hfs_brec_remove(), this has\nunfortunate effect that the last matching extent record is removed\nunconditionally.\n\nTo reproduce this issue, create a file which has at least 10 extents, and\nthen perform shrinking truncate into middle of the last extent record, so\nthat the number of remaining extents is not under or divisible by 8.  This\ncauses the last extent record (8 extents) to be removed totally instead of\ntruncating into middle of it.  Thus this causes corruption, and lost data.\n\nFix for this is simply checking if the new truncated end is below the\nstart of this extent record, making it safe to remove the full extent\nrecord.  However call to hfs_brec_remove() can't be moved to it's previous\nplace since we're dropping ->tree_lock and it can cause a race condition\nand the cached info being invalidated possibly corrupting the node data.\n\nAnother issue is related to this one.  When entering into the block\n(blk_cnt > start) we are not holding the ->tree_lock.  We break out from\nthe loop not holding the lock, but hfs_find_exit() does unlock it.  Not\nsure if it's possible for someone else to take the lock under our feet,\nbut it can cause hard to debug errors and premature unlocking.  Even if\nthere's no real risk of it, the locking should still always be kept in\nbalance.  Thus taking the lock now just before the check."

This issue is observed\nvery rarely on some specific AST2500 SoCs but it causes a critical\nkernel panic with making a various shape of signature so it's extremely\nhard to debug. Moreover, the issue is observed even when the video\nengine is not actively used because udevd turns on the video engine\nhardware for a short time to make a query in every boot.\n\nTo fix this issue, this commit changes the clock handling logic to make\nthe reset de-assertion triggered after enabling both eclk and vclk. Also,\nit adds clk_unprepare call for a case when probe fails.\n\nclk: ast2600: fix reset settings for eclk and vclk\nVideo engine reset setting should be coupled with eclk to match it\nwith the setting for previous Aspeed SoCs which is defined in\nclk-aspeed.c since all Aspeed SoCs are sharing a single video engine\ndriver. Also, reset bit 6 is defined as 'Video Engine' reset in\ndatasheet so it should be de-asserted when eclk is enabled. This\ncommit fixes the setting."

        "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\narm64: entry: always set GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET during entry\n\nZenghui reports that booting a kernel with \"irqchip.gicv3_pseudo_nmi=1\"\non the command line hits a warning during kernel entry, due to the way\nwe manipulate the PMR.\n\nEarly in the entry sequence, we call lockdep_hardirqs_off() to inform\nlockdep that interrupts have been masked (as the HW sets DAIF wqhen\nentering an exception). Architecturally PMR_EL1 is not affected by\nexception entry, and we don't set GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET in the PMR early in\nthe exception entry sequence, so early in exception entry the PMR can\nindicate that interrupts are unmasked even though they are masked by\nDAIF.\n\nIf DEBUG_LOCKDEP is selected, lockdep_hardirqs_off() will check that\ninterrupts are masked, before we set GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET in any of the\nexception entry paths, and hence lockdep_hardirqs_off() will WARN() that\nsomething is amiss.\n\nWe can avoid this by consistently setting GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET during\nexception entry so that kernel code sees a consistent environment. We\nmust also update local_daif_inherit() to undo this, as currently only\ntouches DAIF. For other paths, local_daif_restore() will update both\nDAIF and the PMR. With this done, we can remove the existing special\ncases which set this later in the entry code.\n\nWe always use (GIC_PRIO_IRQON | GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET) for consistency with\nlocal_daif_save(), as this will warn if it ever encounters\n(GIC_PRIO_IRQOFF | GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET), and never sets this itself. This\nmatches the gic_prio_kentry_setup that we have to retain for\nret_to_user.\n\nThe original splat from Zenghui's report was:\n\n| DEBUG_LOCKS_WARN_ON(!irqs_disabled())\n| WARNING: CPU: 3 PID: 125 at kernel/locking/lockdep.c:4258 lockdep_hardirqs_off+0xd4/0xe8\n| Modules linked in:\n| CPU: 3 PID: 125 Comm: modprobe Tainted: G        W         5.12.0-rc8+ #463\n| Hardware name: QEMU KVM Virtual Machine, BIOS 0.0.0 02/06/2015\n| pstate: 604003c5 (nZCv DAIF +PAN -UAO -TCO BTYPE=--)\n| pc : lockdep_hardirqs_off+0xd4/0xe8\n| lr : lockdep_hardirqs_off+0xd4/0xe8\n| sp : ffff80002a39bad0\n| pmr_save: 000000e0\n| x29: ffff80002a39bad0 x28: ffff0000de214bc0\n| x27: ffff0000de1c0400 x26: 000000000049b328\n| x25: 0000000000406f30 x24: ffff0000de1c00a0\n| x23: 0000000020400005 x22: ffff8000105f747c\n| x21: 0000000096000044 x20: 0000000000498ef9\n| x19: ffff80002a39bc88 x18: ffffffffffffffff\n| x17: 0000000000000000 x16: ffff800011c61eb0\n| x15: ffff800011700a88 x14: 0720072007200720\n| x13: 0720072007200720 x12: 0720072007200720\n| x11: 0720072007200720 x10: 0720072007200720\n| x9 : ffff80002a39bad0 x8 : ffff80002a39bad0\n| x7 : ffff8000119f0800 x6 : c0000000ffff7fff\n| x5 : ffff8000119f07a8 x4 : 0000000000000001\n| x3 : 9bcdab23f2432800 x2 : ffff800011730538\n| x1 : 9bcdab23f2432800 x0 : 0000000000000000\n| Call trace:\n|  lockdep_hardirqs_off+0xd4/0xe8\n|  enter_from_kernel_mode.isra.5+0x7c/0xa8\n|  el1_abort+0x24/0x100\n|  el1_sync_handler+0x80/0xd0\n|  el1_sync+0x6c/0x100\n|  __arch_clear_user+0xc/0x90\n|  load_elf_binary+0x9fc/0x1450\n|  bprm_execve+0x404/0x880\n|  kernel_execve+0x180/0x188\n|  call_usermodehelper_exec_async+0xdc/0x158\n|  ret_from_fork+0x10/0x18"
