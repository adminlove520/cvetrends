Once this condition begins, and as long as the attacker is able to sustain the offending traffic, a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) event occurs. As a DDoS event, the offending packets sent by the attacker will continue to flow from one device to another as long as they are received and processed by any devices, ultimately causing a cascading outage to any vulnerable devices. Devices not vulnerable to the memory leak will process and forward the offending packet(s) to neighboring devices. Due to internal anti-flood security controls and mechanisms reaching their maximum limit of response in the worst-case scenario, all affected Junos OS Evolved devices will reboot in as little as 1.5 days. Reboots to restore services cannot be avoided once the memory leak begins. The device will self-recover after crashing and rebooting. Operator intervention isn't required to restart the device.

In a segment-routing scenario with OSPF as IGP, when a peer interface continuously flaps, next-hop churn will happen and a continuous increase in Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) memory consumption will be observed. This will eventually lead to an rpd crash and restart when the memory is full. The memory consumption can be monitored using the CLI command \"show task memory detail\" as shown in the following example: user@host> show task memory detail | match \"RT_NEXTHOPS_TEMPLATE|RT_TEMPLATE_BOOK_KEE\" RT_NEXTHOPS_TEMPLATE 1008 1024 T 50 51200 50 51200 RT_NEXTHOPS_TEMPLATE 688 768 T 50 38400 50 38400 RT_NEXTHOPS_TEMPLATE 368 384 T 412330 158334720 412330 158334720 RT_TEMPLATE_BOOK_KEE 2064 2560 T 33315 85286400 33315 85286400 user@host> show task memory detail | match \"RT_NEXTHOPS_TEMPLATE|RT_TEMPLATE_BOOK_KEE\" RT_NEXTHOPS_TEMPLATE 1008 1024 T 50 51200 50 51200 RT_NEXTHOPS_TEMPLATE 688 768 T 50 38400 50 38400 RT_NEXTHOPS_TEMPLATE 368 384 T 419005 160897920 419005 160897920 <=== RT_TEMPLATE_BOOK_KEE 2064 2560 T 39975 102336000 39975 10233600 <=== This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS All versions prior to 19.3R3-S7; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R2-S8, 19.4R3-S9; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S5; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S5; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S4; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S3; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S2; 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-S1; 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R2-S1, 21.4R3; 22.1 versions prior to 22.1R2.

Upon enabling this specific feature, an attacker sending specific traffic is causing memory to be allocated dynamically and it is not freed. Memory is not freed even after deactivating this feature.
