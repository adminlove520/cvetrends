However, the `vec<T>` method, requires the rank to 1 and triggers a `CHECK` failure otherwise. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.

The input parameter passed in register x1 is not validated well enough in the function sdei_interrupt_bind. The parameter is passed to a call to plat_ic_get_interrupt_type. It can be any arbitrary value passing checks in the function plat_ic_is_sgi. A compromised Normal World (Linux kernel) can enable a root-privileged attacker to issue arbitrary SMC calls. Using this primitive, he can control the content of registers x0 through x6, which are used to send parameters to TF-A. Out-of-bounds addresses can be read in the context of TF-A (EL3). Because the read value is never returned to non-secure memory or in registers, no leak is possible. An attacker can still crash TF-A, however."

For the SR-IOV\ncase, there is no \"ibm,dma-window\". The original commit: b1fc44eaa9ba,\nfixes the path where memory is pre-mapped (direct mapped) to the DDW.\nWhen TCEs are direct mapped, there is no need to initialize IOMMU\ntables.\n\niommu_table_setparms_lpar() only considers \"ibm,dma-window\" property\nwhen initiallizing IOMMU table. In the scenario where TCEs are\ndynamically allocated for SR-IOV, newly created IOMMU table is not\ninitialized. Later, when the device driver tries to enter TCEs for the\nSR-IOV device, NULL pointer execption is thrown from iommu_area_alloc().\n\nThe fix is to initialize the IOMMU table with DDW property stored in the\nFDT. There are 2 points to remember:\n\n\t1. For the dedicated adapter, kdump kernel would encounter both\n\t   default and DDW in FDT. In this case, DDW property is used to\n\t   initialize the IOMMU table.\n\n\t2. A DDW could be direct or dynamic mapped. kdump kernel would\n\t   initialize IOMMU table and mark the existing DDW as\n\t   \"dynamic\". This works fine since, at the time of table\n\t   initialization, iommu_table_clear() makes some space in the\n\t   DDW, for some predefined number of TCEs which are needed for\n\t   kdump to succeed."
