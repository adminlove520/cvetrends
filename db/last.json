        "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: dsa: sja1105: avoid out of bounds access in sja1105_init_l2_policing()\n\nThe SJA1105 family has 45 L2 policing table entries\n(SJA1105_MAX_L2_POLICING_COUNT) and SJA1110 has 110\n(SJA1110_MAX_L2_POLICING_COUNT). Keeping the table structure but\naccounting for the difference in port count (5 in SJA1105 vs 10 in\nSJA1110) does not fully explain the difference. Rather, the SJA1110 also\nhas L2 ingress policers for multicast traffic. If a packet is classified\nas multicast, it will be processed by the policer index 99 + SRCPORT.\n\nThe sja1105_init_l2_policing() function initializes all L2 policers such\nthat they don't interfere with normal packet reception by default. To have\na common code between SJA1105 and SJA1110, the index of the multicast\npolicer for the port is calculated because it's an index that is out of\nbounds for SJA1105 but in bounds for SJA1110, and a bounds check is\nperformed.\n\nThe code fails to do the proper thing when determining what to do with the\nmulticast policer of port 0 on SJA1105 (ds->num_ports = 5). The \"mcast\"\nindex will be equal to 45, which is also equal to\ntable->ops->max_entry_count (SJA1105_MAX_L2_POLICING_COUNT). So it passes\nthrough the check. But at the same time, SJA1105 doesn't have multicast\npolicers. So the code programs the SHARINDX field of an out-of-bounds\nelement in the L2 Policing table of the static config.\n\nThe comparison between index 45 and 45 entries should have determined the\ncode to not access this policer index on SJA1105, since its memory wasn't\neven allocated.\n\nWith enough bad luck, the out-of-bounds write could even overwrite other\nvalid kernel data, but in this case, the issue was detected using KASAN.\n\nKernel log:\n\nsja1105 spi5.0: Probed switch chip: SJA1105Q\n==================================================================\nBUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in sja1105_setup+0x1cbc/0x2340\nWrite of size 8 at addr ffffff880bd57708 by task kworker/u8:0/8\n...\nWorkqueue: events_unbound deferred_probe_work_func\nCall trace:\n...\nsja1105_setup+0x1cbc/0x2340\ndsa_register_switch+0x1284/0x18d0\nsja1105_probe+0x748/0x840\n...\nAllocated by task 8:\n...\nsja1105_setup+0x1bcc/0x2340\ndsa_register_switch+0x1284/0x18d0\nsja1105_probe+0x748/0x840\n..."
