On the socket destruction tcp_ao_info ceases to be\nwith RCU grace period, while tcp-ao static branch is currently deferred\ndestructed. The static key definition is\n: DEFINE_STATIC_KEY_DEFERRED_FALSE(tcp_ao_needed, HZ);\n\nwhich means that if RCU grace period is delayed by more than a second\nand tcp_ao_needed is in the process of disablement, other CPUs may\nyet see tcp_ao_info which atent dead, but soon-to-be.\nAnd that breaks the assumption of static_key_fast_inc_not_disabled().\n\nSee the comment near the definition:\n> * The caller must make sure that the static key can't get disabled while\n> * in this function. It doesn't patch jump labels, only adds a user to\n> * an already enabled static key.\n\nOriginally it was introduced in commit eb8c507296f6 (\"jump_label:\nPrevent key->enabled int overflow\"), which is needed for the atomic\ncontexts, one of which would be the creation of a full socket from a\nrequest socket. In that atomic context, it's known by the presence\nof the key (md5/ao) that the static branch is already enabled.\nSo, the ref counter for that static branch is just incremented\ninstead of holding the proper mutex.\nstatic_key_fast_inc_not_disabled() is just a helper for such usage\ncase. But it must not be used if the static branch could get disabled\nin parallel as it's not protected by jump_label_mutex and as a result,\nraces with jump_label_update() implementation details.\n\nHappened on netdev test-bot[1], so not a theoretical issue:\n\n[] jump_label: Fatal kernel bug, unexpected op at tcp_inbound_hash+0x1a7/0x870 [ffffffffa8c4e9b7] (eb 50 0f 1f 44 != 66 90 0f 1f 00)) size:2 type:1\n[] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n[] kernel BUG at arch/x86/kernel/jump_label.c:73!\n[] Oops: invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN NOPTI\n[] CPU: 3 PID: 243 Comm: kworker/3:3 Not tainted 6.10.0-virtme #1\n[] Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS rel-1.16.3-0-ga6ed6b701f0a-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014\n[] Workqueue: events jump_label_update_timeout\n[] RIP: 0010:__jump_label_patch+0x2f6/0x350\n...\n[] Call Trace:\n[]  <TASK>\n[]  arch_jump_label_transform_queue+0x6c/0x110\n[]  __jump_label_update+0xef/0x350\n[]  __static_key_slow_dec_cpuslocked.part.0+0x3c/0x60\n[]  jump_label_update_timeout+0x2c/0x40\n[]  process_one_work+0xe3b/0x1670\n[]  worker_thread+0x587/0xce0\n[]  kthread+0x28a/0x350\n[]  ret_from_fork+0x31/0x70\n[]  ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30\n[]  </TASK>\n[] Modules linked in: veth\n[] ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---\n[] RIP: 0010:__jump_label_patch+0x2f6/0x350\n\n[1]: https://netdev-3.bots.linux.dev/vmksft-tcp-ao-dbg/results/696681/5-connect-deny-ipv6/stderr"

        "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntracing: Have format file honor EVENT_FILE_FL_FREED\n\nWhen eventfs was introduced, special care had to be done to coordinate the\nfreeing of the file meta data with the files that are exposed to user\nspace. The file meta data would have a ref count that is set when the file\nis created and would be decremented and freed after the last user that\nopened the file closed it. When the file meta data was to be freed, it\nwould set a flag (EVENT_FILE_FL_FREED) to denote that the file is freed,\nand any new references made (like new opens or reads) would fail as it is\nmarked freed. This allowed other meta data to be freed after this flag was\nset (under the event_mutex).\n\nAll the files that were dynamically created in the events directory had a\npointer to the file meta data and would call event_release() when the last\nreference to the user space file was closed. This would be the time that it\nis safe to free the file meta data.\n\nA shortcut was made for the \"format\" file. It's i_private would point to\nthe \"call\" entry directly and not point to the file's meta data. This is\nbecause all format files are the same for the same \"call\", so it was\nthought there was no reason to differentiate them.  The other files\nmaintain state (like the \"enable\", \"trigger\", etc). But this meant if the\nfile were to disappear, the \"format\" file would be unaware of it.\n\nThis caused a race that could be trigger via the user_events test (that\nwould create dynamic events and free them), and running a loop that would\nread the user_events format files:\n\nIn one console run:\n\n # cd tools/testing/selftests/user_events\n # while true; do ./ftrace_test; done\n\nAnd in another console run:\n\n # cd /sys/kernel/tracing/\n # while true; do cat events/user_events/__test_event/format; done 2>/dev/null\n\nWith KASAN memory checking, it would trigger a use-after-free bug report\n(which was a real bug). This was because the format file was not checking\nthe file's meta data flag \"EVENT_FILE_FL_FREED\", so it would access the\nevent that the file meta data pointed to after the event was freed.\n\nAfter inspection, there are other locations that were found to not check\nthe EVENT_FILE_FL_FREED flag when accessing the trace_event_file. Add a\nnew helper function: event_file_file() that will make sure that the\nevent_mutex is held, and will return NULL if the trace_event_file has the\nEVENT_FILE_FL_FREED flag set. Have the first reference of the struct file\npointer use event_file_file() and check for NULL. Later uses can still use\nthe event_file_data() helper function if the event_mutex is still held and\nwas not released since the event_file_file() call."

It introduced IDR to maintain the memcg ID\nspace.  The IDR depends on external synchronization mechanisms for\nmodifications.  For the mem_cgroup_idr, the idr_alloc() and idr_replace()\nhappen within css callback and thus are protected through cgroup_mutex\nfrom concurrent modifications.  However idr_remove() for mem_cgroup_idr\nwas not protected against concurrency and can be run concurrently for\ndifferent memcgs when they hit their refcnt to zero.  Fix that.\n\nWe have been seeing list_lru based kernel crashes at a low frequency in\nour fleet for a long time.  These crashes were in different part of\nlist_lru code including list_lru_add(), list_lru_del() and reparenting\ncode.  Upon further inspection, it looked like for a given object (dentry\nand inode), the super_block's list_lru didn't have list_lru_one for the\nmemcg of that object.  The initial suspicions were either the object is\nnot allocated through kmem_cache_alloc_lru() or somehow\nmemcg_list_lru_alloc() failed to allocate list_lru_one() for a memcg but\nreturned success.  No evidence were found for these cases.\n\nLooking more deeply, we started seeing situations where valid memcg's id\nis not present in mem_cgroup_idr and in some cases multiple valid memcgs\nhave same id and mem_cgroup_idr is pointing to one of them.  So, the most\nreasonable explanation is that these situations can happen due to race\nbetween multiple idr_remove() calls or race between\nidr_alloc()/idr_replace() and idr_remove().  These races are causing\nmultiple memcgs to acquire the same ID and then offlining of one of them\nwould cleanup list_lrus on the system for all of them.  Later access from\nother memcgs to the list_lru cause crashes due to missing list_lru_one."

Due to improper privilege management concerning sudo privileges, C-MOR is vulnerable to a privilege escalation attack. The Linux user www-data running the C-MOR web interface can execute some OS commands as root via Sudo without having to enter the root password. These commands, for example, include cp, chown, and chmod, which enable an attacker to modify the system's sudoers file in order to execute all commands with root privileges. Thus, it is possible to escalate the limited privileges of the user www-data to root privileges."
