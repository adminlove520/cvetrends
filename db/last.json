As part of that patch,\nsizeof(void *) was used as the buffer size for 0-length data payloads so\nthe driver could detect abusive clients sending 0-length asynchronous\ntransactions to a server by enforcing limits on async_free_size.\n\nUnfortunately, on the \"free\" side, the accounting of async_free_space\ndid not add the sizeof(void *) back. The result was that up to 8-bytes of\nasync_free_space were leaked on every async transaction of 8-bytes or\nless.  These small transactions are uncommon, so this accounting issue\nhas gone undetected for several years.\n\nThe fix is to use \"buffer_size\" (the allocated buffer size) instead of\n\"size\" (the logical buffer size) when updating the async_free_space\nduring the free operation. These are the same except for this\ncorner case of asynchronous transactions with payloads < 8 bytes."

This patch uses call_rcu() and moves sock_put and\nep free into sctp_endpoint_destroy_rcu(), so that it's safe to try to\nhold the ep under rcu_read_lock in sctp_transport_traverse_process().\n\nIf sctp_endpoint_hold() returns true, it means this ep is still alive\nand we have held it and can continue to dump it; If it returns false,\nit means this ep is dead and can be freed after rcu_read_unlock, and\nwe should skip it.\n\nIn sctp_sock_dump(), after locking the sk, if this ep is different from\ntsp->asoc->ep, it means during this dumping, this asoc was peeled off\nbefore calling lock_sock(), and the sk should be skipped; If this ep is\nthe same with tsp->asoc->ep, it means no peeloff happens on this asoc,\nand due to lock_sock, no peeloff will happen either until release_sock.\n\nNote that delaying endpoint free won't delay the port release, as the\nport release happens in sctp_endpoint_destroy() before calling call_rcu().\nAlso, freeing endpoint by call_rcu() makes it safe to access the sk by\nasoc->base.sk in sctp_assocs_seq_show() and sctp_rcv().\n\nThanks Jones to bring this issue up.\n\nv1->v2:\n  - improve the changelog.\n  - add kfree(ep) into sctp_endpoint_destroy_rcu(), as Jakub noticed."

The freed entry is later used and overwritten with potentially bad actor-controlled data leading to controlled heap corruption.

Thus, they operate globally.\n\nBecause ipv4_net_table does not use designated initializers, there is no\neasy way to fix up this one \"bad\" table entry. However, the data pointer\nupdating logic shouldn't be applied to NULL pointers anyway, so we\ninstead force these entries to be read-only.\n\nThese sysctls used to exist in ipv4_table (init-net only), but they were\nmoved to the per-net ipv4_net_table, presumably without realizing that\ntcp_allowed_congestion_control was writable and thus introduced a leak.\n\nBecause the intent of that commit was only to know (i.e. read) \"which\ncongestion algorithms are available or allowed\", this read-only solution\nshould be sufficient.\n\nThe logic added in recent commit\n31c4d2f160eb: (\"net: Ensure net namespace isolation of sysctls\")\ndoes not and cannot check for NULL data pointers, because\nother table entries (e.g. /proc/sys/net/netfilter/nf_log/) have\n.data=NULL but use other methods (.extra2) to access the struct net."

The previous patch of [GHSA-8599-x7rq-fr54](https://github.com/freeswitch/sofia-sip/security/advisories/GHSA-8599-x7rq-fr54) fixed the vulnerability when attr_type did not match the enum value, but there are also vulnerabilities in the handling of other valid cases. The OOB read and integer-overflow made by attacker may lead to crash, high consumption of memory or even other more serious consequences. These issue have been addressed in version 1.13.15.

In version 0.0.31 and earlier, it is possible for an attacker to register a repository with a invalid or differing upstream ID, which causes Minder to report the repository as registered, but not remediate any future changes which conflict with policy (because the webhooks for the repo do not match any known repository in the database).  When attempting to register a repo with a different repo ID, the registered provider must have admin on the named repo, or a 404 error will result.  Similarly, if the stored provider token does not have repo access, then the remediations will not apply successfully.  Lastly, it appears that reconciliation actions do not execute against repos with this type of mismatch. This appears to primarily be a potential denial-of-service vulnerability.  This vulnerability is patched in version 0.20240226.1425+ref.53868a8."

        "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nIB/hfi1: Fix bugs with non-PAGE_SIZE-end multi-iovec user SDMA requests\n\nhfi1 user SDMA request processing has two bugs that can cause data\ncorruption for user SDMA requests that have multiple payload iovecs\nwhere an iovec other than the tail iovec does not run up to the page\nboundary for the buffer pointed to by that iovec.a\n\nHere are the specific bugs:\n1. user_sdma_txadd() does not use struct user_sdma_iovec->iov.iov_len.\n   Rather, user_sdma_txadd() will add up to PAGE_SIZE bytes from iovec\n   to the packet, even if some of those bytes are past\n   iovec->iov.iov_len and are thus not intended to be in the packet.\n2. user_sdma_txadd() and user_sdma_send_pkts() fail to advance to the\n   next iovec in user_sdma_request->iovs when the current iovec\n   is not PAGE_SIZE and does not contain enough data to complete the\n   packet. The transmitted packet will contain the wrong data from the\n   iovec pages.\n\nThis has not been an issue with SDMA packets from hfi1 Verbs or PSM2\nbecause they only produce iovecs that end short of PAGE_SIZE as the tail\niovec of an SDMA request.\n\nFixing these bugs exposes other bugs with the SDMA pin cache\n(struct mmu_rb_handler) that get in way of supporting user SDMA requests\nwith multiple payload iovecs whose buffers do not end at PAGE_SIZE. So\nthis commit fixes those issues as well.\n\nHere are the mmu_rb_handler bugs that non-PAGE_SIZE-end multi-iovec\npayload user SDMA requests can hit:\n1. Overlapping memory ranges in mmu_rb_handler will result in duplicate\n   pinnings.\n2. When extending an existing mmu_rb_handler entry (struct mmu_rb_node),\n   the mmu_rb code (1) removes the existing entry under a lock, (2)\n   releases that lock, pins the new pages, (3) then reacquires the lock\n   to insert the extended mmu_rb_node.\n\n   If someone else comes in and inserts an overlapping entry between (2)\n   and (3), insert in (3) will fail.\n\n   The failure path code in this case unpins _all_ pages in either the\n   original mmu_rb_node or the new mmu_rb_node that was inserted between\n   (2) and (3).\n3. In hfi1_mmu_rb_remove_unless_exact(), mmu_rb_node->refcount is\n   incremented outside of mmu_rb_handler->lock. As a result, mmu_rb_node\n   could be evicted by another thread that gets mmu_rb_handler->lock and\n   checks mmu_rb_node->refcount before mmu_rb_node->refcount is\n   incremented.\n4. Related to #2 above, SDMA request submission failure path does not\n   check mmu_rb_node->refcount before freeing mmu_rb_node object.\n\n   If there are other SDMA requests in progress whose iovecs have\n   pointers to the now-freed mmu_rb_node(s), those pointers to the\n   now-freed mmu_rb nodes will be dereferenced when those SDMA requests\n   complete."
