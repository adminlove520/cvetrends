        "summary": "Svelecte is a flexible autocomplete/select component written in Svelte. Svelecte item names are rendered as raw HTML with no escaping. This allows the injection of arbitrary HTML into the Svelecte dropdown. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary JavaScript whenever a Svelecte dropdown is opened. Item names given to Svelecte appear to be directly rendered as HTML by the default item renderer. This means that any HTML tags in the name are rendered as HTML elements not as text. Note that the custom item renderer shown in https://mskocik.github.io/svelecte/#item-rendering is also vulnerable to the same exploit. Any site that uses Svelecte with dynamically created items either from an external source or from user-created content could be vulnerable to an XSS attack (execution of untrusted JavaScript), clickjacking or any other attack that can be performed with arbitrary HTML injection. The actual impact of this vulnerability for a specific application depends on how trustworthy the sources that provide Svelecte items are and the steps that the application has taken to mitigate XSS attacks. XSS attacks using this vulnerability are mostly mitigated by a Content Security Policy that blocks inline JavaScript. This issue has been addressed in version 3.16.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n"

This is triggered when the affected components try to modify a manipulated environment, in particular its user variables. Furthermore, `bg_printenv` may crash over invalid read accesses or report invalid results. Not affected by this issue is EFI Boot Guard's bootloader EFI binary. EFI Boot Guard release v0.15 contains required patches to sanitize and validate the bootloader environment prior to processing it in userspace. Its library and tools should be updated, so should programs statically linked against it. An update of the bootloader EFI executable is not required. The only way to prevent the issue with an unpatched EFI Boot Guard version is to avoid accesses to user variables, specifically modifications to them."

According to the docs, svg-loader will strip all JS code before injecting the SVG file for security reasons but the input sanitization logic is not sufficient and can be trivially bypassed. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious SVG which can result in Cross-site Scripting (XSS). When trying to sanitize the svg the lib removes event attributes such as `onmouseover`, `onclick` but the list of events is not exhaustive.  Any website which uses external-svg-loader and allows its users to provide svg src, upload svg files would be susceptible to stored XSS attack. This issue has been addressed in commit `d3562fc08` which is included in releases from 1.6.9. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."

        "summary": "An issue was discovered in Tigergraph Enterprise 3.7.0. The TigerGraph platform allows users to define new User Defined Functions (UDFs) from C/C++ code. To support this functionality TigerGraph allows users to upload custom C/C++ code which is then compiled and installed into the platform. An attacker who has filesystem access on a remote TigerGraph system can alter the behavior of the database against the will of the database administrator; thus effectively bypassing the built in RBAC controls."
