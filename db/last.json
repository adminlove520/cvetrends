Access can be be made more lenient via newly introduced system properties where needed.\n\nUsers of Ivy prior to version 2.5.2 can use Java system properties to restrict processing of external DTDs, see the section about \"JAXP Properties for External Access restrictions\" inside Oracle's \"Java API for XML Processing (JAXP) Security Guide\".\n\n"

When all of the following conditions are met, a response containing data intended for one client may be cached and subsequently sent by the proxy to other clients. If the proxy also caches `Set-Cookie` headers, it may send one client's `session` cookie to other clients. The severity depends on the application's use of the session and the proxy's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on all these conditions being met.\n\n1. The application must be hosted behind a caching proxy that does not strip cookies or ignore responses with cookies.\n2. The application sets `session.permanent = True`\n3. The application does not access or modify the session at any point during a request.\n4. `SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST` enabled (the default).\n5. The application does not set a `Cache-Control` header to indicate that a page is private or should not be cached.\n\nThis happens because vulnerable versions of Flask only set the `Vary: Cookie` header when the session is accessed or modified, not when it is refreshed (re-sent to update the expiration) without being accessed or modified. This issue has been fixed in versions 2.3.2 and 2.2.5."
