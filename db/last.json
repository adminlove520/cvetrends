However,\ndup_user_cpus_ptr() accesses user_cpus_ptr without any lock\nprotection. Since sched_setaffinity() can be invoked from another\nprocess, the process being modified may be undergoing fork() at\nthe same time.  When racing with the clearing of user_cpus_ptr in\n__set_cpus_allowed_ptr_locked(), it can lead to user-after-free and\npossibly double-free in arm64 kernel.\n\nCommit 8f9ea86fdf99 (\"sched: Always preserve the user requested\ncpumask\") fixes this problem as user_cpus_ptr, once set, will never\nbe cleared in a task's lifetime. However, this bug was re-introduced\nin commit 851a723e45d1 (\"sched: Always clear user_cpus_ptr in\ndo_set_cpus_allowed()\") which allows the clearing of user_cpus_ptr in\ndo_set_cpus_allowed(). This time, it will affect all arches.\n\nFix this bug by always clearing the user_cpus_ptr of the newly\ncloned/forked task before the copying process starts and check the\nuser_cpus_ptr state of the source task under pi_lock.\n\nNote to stable, this patch won't be applicable to stable releases.\nJust copy the new dup_user_cpus_ptr() function over."

The steps for\nthis are the following:\n\n1) Quotas are enabled;\n\n2) Task A calls the quota rescan ioctl and enters btrfs_qgroup_rescan().\n   It calls qgroup_rescan_init() which returns 0 (success) and then joins a\n   transaction and commits it;\n\n3) Task B calls the quota disable ioctl and enters btrfs_quota_disable().\n   It clears the bit BTRFS_FS_QUOTA_ENABLED from fs_info->flags and calls\n   btrfs_qgroup_wait_for_completion(), which returns immediately since the\n   rescan worker is not yet running.\n   Then it starts a transaction and locks fs_info->qgroup_ioctl_lock;\n\n4) Task A queues the rescan worker, by calling btrfs_queue_work();\n\n5) The rescan worker starts, and calls rescan_should_stop() at the start\n   of its while loop, which results in 0 iterations of the loop, since\n   the flag BTRFS_FS_QUOTA_ENABLED was cleared from fs_info->flags by\n   task B at step 3);\n\n6) Task B sets fs_info->quota_root to NULL;\n\n7) The rescan worker tries to start a transaction and uses\n   fs_info->quota_root as the root argument for btrfs_start_transaction().\n   This results in a NULL pointer dereference down the call chain of\n   btrfs_start_transaction().

There are a couple of problems with the way this currently\nworks:\n\nIt's racy, as a newly-created nfsd_file can end up with its PENDING bit\ncleared while the nf is hashed, and the nf_file pointer is still zeroed\nout. Other tasks can find it in this state and they expect to see a\nvalid nf_file, and can oops if nf_file is NULL.\n\nAlso, there is no guarantee that we'll end up creating a new nfsd_file\nif one is already in the hash. If an extant entry is in the hash with a\nvalid nf_file, nfs4_get_vfs_file will clobber its nf_file pointer with\nthe value of op_file and the old nf_file will leak.\n\nFix both issues by making a new nfsd_file_acquirei_opened variant that\ntakes an optional file pointer. If one is present when this is called,\nwe'll take a new reference to it instead of trying to open the file. If\nthe nfsd_file already has a valid nf_file, we'll just ignore the\noptional file and pass the nfsd_file back as-is.\n\nAlso rework the tracepoints a bit to allow for an \"opened\" variant and\ndon't try to avoid counting acquisitions in the case where we already\nhave a cached open file."

For\nexample, the iova domain size is 10M, start_pfn is 0x1_F000_0000,\nand the iova size allocated for the first time is 11M. The\nfollowing is the log information, new->pfn_lo is smaller than\niovad->cached_node.\n\nExample log as follows:\n[  223.798112][T1705487] sh: [name:iova&]__alloc_and_insert_iova_range\nstart_pfn:0x1f0000,retry_pfn:0x0,size:0xb00,limit_pfn:0x1f0a00\n[  223.799590][T1705487] sh: [name:iova&]__alloc_and_insert_iova_range\nsuccess start_pfn:0x1f0000,new->pfn_lo:0x1efe00,new->pfn_hi:0x1f08ff\n\n2. The node with the largest iova->pfn_lo value in the iova domain\nis deleted, iovad->cached_node will be updated to iovad->anchor,\nand then the alloc iova size exceeds the maximum iova size that can\nbe allocated in the domain.\n\nAfter judging that retry_pfn is less than limit_pfn, call retry_pfn+1\nto fix the overflow issue."

        "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nPCI: rcar: Demote WARN() to dev_warn_ratelimited() in rcar_pcie_wakeup()\n\nAvoid large backtrace, it is sufficient to warn the user that there has\nbeen a link problem. Either the link has failed and the system is in need\nof maintenance, or the link continues to work and user has been informed.\nThe message from the warning can be looked up in the sources.\n\nThis makes an actual link issue less verbose.\n\nFirst of all, this controller has a limitation in that the controller\ndriver has to assist the hardware with transition to L1 link state by\nwriting L1IATN to PMCTRL register, the L1 and L0 link state switching\nis not fully automatic on this controller.\n\nIn case of an ASMedia ASM1062 PCIe SATA controller which does not support\nASPM, on entry to suspend or during platform pm_test, the SATA controller\nenters D3hot state and the link enters L1 state. If the SATA controller\nwakes up before rcar_pcie_wakeup() was called and returns to D0, the link\nreturns to L0 before the controller driver even started its transition to\nL1 link state. At this point, the SATA controller did send an PM_ENTER_L1\nDLLP to the PCIe controller and the PCIe controller received it, and the\nPCIe controller did set PMSR PMEL1RX bit.\n\nOnce rcar_pcie_wakeup() is called, if the link is already back in L0 state\nand PMEL1RX bit is set, the controller driver has no way to determine if\nit should perform the link transition to L1 state, or treat the link as if\nit is in L0 state. Currently the driver attempts to perform the transition\nto L1 link state unconditionally, which in this specific case fails with a\nPMSR L1FAEG poll timeout, however the link still works as it is already\nback in L0 state.\n\nReduce this warning verbosity. In case the link is really broken, the\nrcar_pcie_config_access() would fail, otherwise it will succeed and any\nsystem with this controller and ASM1062 can suspend without generating\na backtrace."

        "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmlxsw: spectrum_acl_erp: Fix object nesting warning\n\nACLs in Spectrum-2 and newer ASICs can reside in the algorithmic TCAM\n(A-TCAM) or in the ordinary circuit TCAM (C-TCAM). The former can\ncontain more ACLs (i.e., tc filters), but the number of masks in each\nregion (i.e., tc chain) is limited.\n\nIn order to mitigate the effects of the above limitation, the device\nallows filters to share a single mask if their masks only differ in up\nto 8 consecutive bits. For example, dst_ip/25 can be represented using\ndst_ip/24 with a delta of 1 bit. The C-TCAM does not have a limit on the\nnumber of masks being used (and therefore does not support mask\naggregation), but can contain a limited number of filters.\n\nThe driver uses the \"objagg\" library to perform the mask aggregation by\npassing it objects that consist of the filter's mask and whether the\nfilter is to be inserted into the A-TCAM or the C-TCAM since filters in\ndifferent TCAMs cannot share a mask.\n\nThe set of created objects is dependent on the insertion order of the\nfilters and is not necessarily optimal. Therefore, the driver will\nperiodically ask the library to compute a more optimal set (\"hints\") by\nlooking at all the existing objects.\n\nWhen the library asks the driver whether two objects can be aggregated\nthe driver only compares the provided masks and ignores the A-TCAM /\nC-TCAM indication. This is the right thing to do since the goal is to\nmove as many filters as possible to the A-TCAM. The driver also forbids\ntwo identical masks from being aggregated since this can only happen if\none was intentionally put in the C-TCAM to avoid a conflict in the\nA-TCAM.\n\nThe above can result in the following set of hints:\n\nH1: {mask X, A-TCAM} -> H2: {mask Y, A-TCAM} // X is Y + delta\nH3: {mask Y, C-TCAM} -> H4: {mask Z, A-TCAM} // Y is Z + delta\n\nAfter getting the hints from the library the driver will start migrating\nfilters from one region to another while consulting the computed hints\nand instructing the device to perform a lookup in both regions during\nthe transition.\n\nAssuming a filter with mask X is being migrated into the A-TCAM in the\nnew region, the hints lookup will return H1. Since H2 is the parent of\nH1, the library will try to find the object associated with it and\ncreate it if necessary in which case another hints lookup (recursive)\nwill be performed. This hints lookup for {mask Y, A-TCAM} will either\nreturn H2 or H3 since the driver passes the library an object comparison\nfunction that ignores the A-TCAM / C-TCAM indication.\n\nThis can eventually lead to nested objects which are not supported by\nthe library [1].\n\nFix by removing the object comparison function from both the driver and\nthe library as the driver was the only user. That way the lookup will\nonly return exact matches.\n\nI do not have a reliable reproducer that can reproduce the issue in a\ntimely manner, but before the fix the issue would reproduce in several\nminutes and with the fix it does not reproduce in over an hour.\n\nNote that the current usefulness of the hints is limited because they\ninclude the C-TCAM indication and represent aggregation that cannot\nactually happen. This will be addressed in net-next.\n\n[1]\nWARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 153 at lib/objagg.c:170 objagg_obj_parent_assign+0xb5/0xd0\nModules linked in:\nCPU: 0 PID: 153 Comm: kworker/0:18 Not tainted 6.9.0-rc6-custom-g70fbc2c1c38b #42\nHardware name: Mellanox Technologies Ltd.

        "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nexec: Fix ToCToU between perm check and set-uid/gid usage\n\nWhen opening a file for exec via do_filp_open(), permission checking is\ndone against the file's metadata at that moment, and on success, a file\npointer is passed back. Much later in the execve() code path, the file\nmetadata (specifically mode, uid, and gid) is used to determine if/how\nto set the uid and gid. However, those values may have changed since the\npermissions check, meaning the execution may gain unintended privileges.\n\nFor example, if a file could change permissions from executable and not\nset-id:\n\n---------x 1 root root 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target\n\nto set-id and non-executable:\n\n---S------ 1 root root 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target\n\nit is possible to gain root privileges when execution should have been\ndisallowed.\n\nWhile this race condition is rare in real-world scenarios, it has been\nobserved (and proven exploitable) when package managers are updating\nthe setuid bits of installed programs. Such files start with being\nworld-executable but then are adjusted to be group-exec with a set-uid\nbit. For example, \"chmod o-x,u+s target\" makes \"target\" executable only\nby uid \"root\" and gid \"cdrom\", while also becoming setuid-root:\n\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root cdrom 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target\n\nbecomes:\n\n-rwsr-xr-- 1 root cdrom 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target\n\nBut racing the chmod means users without group \"cdrom\" membership can\nget the permission to execute \"target\" just before the chmod, and when\nthe chmod finishes, the exec reaches brpm_fill_uid(), and performs the\nsetuid to root, violating the expressed authorization of \"only cdrom\ngroup members can setuid to root\".\n\nRe-check that we still have execute permissions in case the metadata\nhas changed. It would be better to keep a copy from the perm-check time,\nbut until we can do that refactoring, the least-bad option is to do a\nfull inode_permission() call (under inode lock). It is understood that\nthis is safe against dead-locks, but hardly optimal."

The fence destroy callback\nboth deletes the fence and removes it from the list of pending\nfences, for which it holds a lock.\n\ndma buf polling cb unrefs a fence after it's been signaled: so the poll\ncalls the wait, which signals the fences, which are being destroyed.\nThe destruction tries to acquire the lock on the pending fences list\nwhich it can never get because it's held by the wait from which it\nwas called.\n\nOld bug, but not a lot of userspace apps were using dma-buf polling\ninterfaces. Fix those, in particular this fixes KDE stalls/deadlock."
