This keeps\ntrack of all in-flight cancellation requests for a given BPF timer.\nWhenever cancelling a BPF timer, we must check if we have outstanding\ncancellation requests, and if so, we must fail the operation with an\nerror (-EDEADLK) since cancellation is synchronous and waits for the\ncallback to finish executing. This implies that we can enter a deadlock\nsituation involving two or more timer callbacks executing in parallel\nand attempting to cancel one another.\n\nNote that we avoid incrementing the cancelling counter for the target\ntimer (the one being cancelled) if bpf_timer_cancel is not invoked from\na callback, to avoid spurious errors. The whole point of detecting\ncur->cancelling and returning -EDEADLK is to not enter a busy wait loop\n(which may or may not lead to a lockup). This does not apply in case the\ncaller is in a non-callback context, the other side can continue to\ncancel as it sees fit without running into errors.\n\nBackground on prior attempts:\n\nEarlier versions of this patch used a bool 'cancelling' bit and used the\nfollowing pattern under timer->lock to publish cancellation status.\n\nlock(t->lock);\nt->cancelling = true;\nmb();\nif (cur->cancelling)\n\treturn -EDEADLK;\nunlock(t->lock);\nhrtimer_cancel(t->timer);\nt->cancelling = false;\n\nThe store outside the critical section could overwrite a parallel\nrequests t->cancelling assignment to true, to ensure the parallely\nexecuting callback observes its cancellation status.\n\nIt would be necessary to clear this cancelling bit once hrtimer_cancel\nis done, but lack of serialization introduced races. Another option was\nexplored where bpf_timer_start would clear the bit when (re)starting the\ntimer under timer->lock. This would ensure serialized access to the\ncancelling bit, but may allow it to be cleared before in-flight\nhrtimer_cancel has finished executing, such that lockups can occur\nagain.\n\nThus, we choose an atomic counter to keep track of all outstanding\ncancellation requests and use it to prevent lockups in case callbacks\nattempt to cancel each other while executing in parallel."

In our\ntest whose code is attached below, we hit the WARN_ON() on ARM64 system\nwhere the base page size is 64KB and huge page size is 512MB.  The issue\nwas reported long time ago and some discussions on it can be found here\n[1].\n\n[1] https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-xfs/msg75404.html\n\nIn order to fix the issue, we need to adjust MAX_PAGECACHE_ORDER to one\nsupported by xarray and avoid PMD-sized page cache if needed.

We observed such hard lockups with\na user who affined O(10k) threads to a single cpu.\n\nWhen I discussed this with Vincent he initially suggested that we keep\nthe limit on the number of tasks to detach, but increase the number of\ntasks we can search.

        "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/bhi: Avoid warning in #DB handler due to BHI mitigation\n\nWhen BHI mitigation is enabled, if SYSENTER is invoked with the TF flag set\nthen entry_SYSENTER_compat() uses CLEAR_BRANCH_HISTORY and calls the\nclear_bhb_loop() before the TF flag is cleared. This causes the #DB handler\n(exc_debug_kernel()) to issue a warning because single-step is used outside the\nentry_SYSENTER_compat() function.\n\nTo address this issue, entry_SYSENTER_compat() should use CLEAR_BRANCH_HISTORY\nafter making sure the TF flag is cleared.\n\nThe problem can be reproduced with the following sequence:\n\n  $ cat sysenter_step.c\n  int main()\n  { asm(\"pushf; pop %ax; bts $8,%ax; push %ax; popf; sysenter\"); }\n\n  $ gcc -o sysenter_step sysenter_step.c\n\n  $ ./sysenter_step\n  Segmentation fault (core dumped)\n\nThe program is expected to crash, and the #DB handler will issue a warning.\n\nKernel log:\n\n  WARNING: CPU: 27 PID: 7000 at arch/x86/kernel/traps.c:1009 exc_debug_kernel+0xd2/0x160\n  ...\n  RIP: 0010:exc_debug_kernel+0xd2/0x160\n  ...\n  Call Trace:\n  <#DB>\n   ? show_regs+0x68/0x80\n   ? __warn+0x8c/0x140\n   ? exc_debug_kernel+0xd2/0x160\n   ? report_bug+0x175/0x1a0\n   ? handle_bug+0x44/0x90\n   ? exc_invalid_op+0x1c/0x70\n   ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1f/0x30\n   ? exc_debug_kernel+0xd2/0x160\n   exc_debug+0x43/0x50\n   asm_exc_debug+0x1e/0x40\n  RIP: 0010:clear_bhb_loop+0x0/0xb0\n  ...\n  </#DB>\n  <TASK>\n   ? entry_SYSENTER_compat_after_hwframe+0x6e/0x8d\n  </TASK>\n\n  [ bp: Massage commit message. ]"

        "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet, sunrpc: Remap EPERM in case of connection failure in xs_tcp_setup_socket\n\nWhen using a BPF program on kernel_connect(), the call can return -EPERM. This\ncauses xs_tcp_setup_socket() to loop forever, filling up the syslog and causing\nthe kernel to potentially freeze up.\n\nNeil suggested:\n\n  This will propagate -EPERM up into other layers which might not be ready\n  to handle it. It might be safer to map EPERM to an error we would be more\n  likely to expect from the network system - such as ECONNREFUSED or ENETDOWN.\n\nECONNREFUSED as error seems reasonable. For programs setting a different error\ncan be out of reach (see handling in 4fbac77d2d09) in particular on kernels\nwhich do not have f10d05966196 (\"bpf: Make BPF_PROG_RUN_ARRAY return -err\ninstead of allow boolean\"), thus given that it is better to simply remap for\nconsistent behavior. UDP does handle EPERM in xs_udp_send_request()."
