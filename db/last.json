Due to use of an unchecked chunk length, an unrecoverable fatal error can occur in versions prior to 1.1.10.1.\n\nThe code in the function hasNextChunk in the fileSnappyInputStream.java checks if a given stream has more chunks to read. It does that by attempting to read 4 bytes. If it wasn\u2019t possible to read the 4 bytes, the function returns false. Otherwise, if 4 bytes were available, the code treats them as the length of the next chunk.\n\nIn the case that the `compressed` variable is null, a byte array is allocated with the size given by the input data. Since the code doesn\u2019t test the legality of the `chunkSize` variable, it is possible to pass a negative number (such as 0xFFFFFFFF which is -1), which will cause the code to raise a `java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException` exception. A worse case would happen when passing a huge positive value (such as 0x7FFFFFFF), which would raise the fatal `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError` error.\n\nVersion 1.1.10.1 contains a patch for this issue."

This vulnerability allows an attacker to create or overwrite arbitrary files on the system ,depending on the privileges of the process running pandoc. It only affects systems that pass untrusted user input to pandoc and allow pandoc to be used to produce a PDF or with the `--extract-media` option.\n\nThe fix is to unescape the percent-encoding prior to checking that the resource is not above the working directory, and prior to extracting the extension.  Some code for checking that the path is below the working directory was flawed in a similar way and has also been fixed. Note that the `--sandbox` option, which only affects IO done by readers and writers themselves, does not block this vulnerability. The vulnerability is patched in pandoc 3.1.4. As a workaround, audit the pandoc command and disallow PDF output and the `--extract-media` option.\n"

        "summary": "aiven-extras is a PostgreSQL extension. Versions prior to 1.1.9 contain a privilege escalation vulnerability, allowing elevation to superuser inside PostgreSQL databases that use the aiven-extras package. The vulnerability leverages missing schema qualifiers on privileged functions called by the aiven-extras extension. A low privileged user can create objects that collide with existing function names, which will then be executed instead. Exploiting this vulnerability could allow a low privileged user to acquire `superuser` privileges, which would allow full, unrestricted access to all data and database functions. And could lead to arbitrary code execution or data access on the underlying host as the `postgres` user. The issue has been patched as of version 1.1.9."

The unmapping time depends on whether it merges with the victim's page and additional physical pages are created beyond the KSM's \"max page share\".

The same attack could be used by a malicious image to allow a container process to gain access to the host filesystem through runc run (\"attack 1\").

This occurs because of file-descriptor mishandling, related to /proc/self/exe."
