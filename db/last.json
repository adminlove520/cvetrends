        "summary": "Zitadel is an open source identity management system. Zitadel uses a cookie to identify the user agent (browser) and its user sessions.  Although the cookie was handled according to best practices, it was accessible on subdomains of the ZITADEL instance. An attacker could take advantage of this and provide a malicious link hosted on the subdomain to the user to gain access to the victim\u2019s account in certain scenarios. A possible victim would need to login through the malicious link for this exploit to work. If the possible victim already had the cookie present, the attack would not succeed. The attack would further only be possible if there was an initial vulnerability on the subdomain. This could either be the attacker being able to control DNS or a XSS vulnerability in an application hosted on a subdomain. Versions 2.46.0, 2.45.1, and 2.44.3 have been patched. Zitadel recommends upgrading to the latest versions available in due course. Note that applying the patch will invalidate the current cookie and thus users will need to start a new session and existing sessions (user selection) will be empty. For self-hosted environments unable to upgrade to a patched version, prevent setting the following cookie name on subdomains of your Zitadel instance (e.g. within your WAF): `__Secure-zitadel-useragent`."

        "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nserial: sc16is7xx: convert from _raw_ to _noinc_ regmap functions for FIFO\n\nThe SC16IS7XX IC supports a burst mode to access the FIFOs where the\ninitial register address is sent ($00), followed by all the FIFO data\nwithout having to resend the register address each time. In this mode, the\nIC doesn't increment the register address for each R/W byte.\n\nThe regmap_raw_read() and regmap_raw_write() are functions which can\nperform IO over multiple registers. They are currently used to read/write\nfrom/to the FIFO, and although they operate correctly in this burst mode on\nthe SPI bus, they would corrupt the regmap cache if it was not disabled\nmanually. The reason is that when the R/W size is more than 1 byte, these\nfunctions assume that the register address is incremented and handle the\ncache accordingly.\n\nConvert FIFO R/W functions to use the regmap _noinc_ versions in order to\nremove the manual cache control which was a workaround when using the\n_raw_ versions. FIFO registers are properly declared as volatile so\ncache will not be used/updated for FIFO accesses."

Since normal zone start and end\npfn contains the device memory PFN's as well, the compaction triggered\nwill try on the device memory PFN's too though they end up in NOP(because\npfn_to_online_page() returns NULL for ZONE_DEVICE memory sections).  When\nfrom other core, the section mappings are being removed for the\nZONE_DEVICE region, that the PFN in question belongs to, on which\ncompaction is currently being operated is resulting into the kernel crash\nwith CONFIG_SPASEMEM_VMEMAP enabled.
