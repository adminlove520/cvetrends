For the SR-IOV\ncase, there is no \"ibm,dma-window\". The original commit: b1fc44eaa9ba,\nfixes the path where memory is pre-mapped (direct mapped) to the DDW.\nWhen TCEs are direct mapped, there is no need to initialize IOMMU\ntables.\n\niommu_table_setparms_lpar() only considers \"ibm,dma-window\" property\nwhen initiallizing IOMMU table. In the scenario where TCEs are\ndynamically allocated for SR-IOV, newly created IOMMU table is not\ninitialized. Later, when the device driver tries to enter TCEs for the\nSR-IOV device, NULL pointer execption is thrown from iommu_area_alloc().\n\nThe fix is to initialize the IOMMU table with DDW property stored in the\nFDT. There are 2 points to remember:\n\n\t1. For the dedicated adapter, kdump kernel would encounter both\n\t   default and DDW in FDT. In this case, DDW property is used to\n\t   initialize the IOMMU table.\n\n\t2. A DDW could be direct or dynamic mapped. kdump kernel would\n\t   initialize IOMMU table and mark the existing DDW as\n\t   \"dynamic\". This works fine since, at the time of table\n\t   initialization, iommu_table_clear() makes some space in the\n\t   DDW, for some predefined number of TCEs which are needed for\n\t   kdump to succeed."

Thus, these builders (which are running under the `nixbld*` users) had read access to world-readable paths and write access to world-writable paths outside of the sandbox. This issue is fixed in 2.18.9, 2.19.7, 2.20.9, 2.21.5, 2.22.4, 2.23.4, and 2.24.10. Note that sandboxing is not enabled by default on macOS. The Nix sandbox is not primarily intended as a security mechanism, but as an aid to improve reproducibility and purity of Nix builds. However, sandboxing *can* mitigate the impact of other security issues by limiting what parts of the host system a build has access to."
