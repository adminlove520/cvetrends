RaspberryMatic / OCCU prior to version 3.75.6.20240316 contains a unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, caused by multiple issues within the Java based `HMIPServer.jar` component. RaspberryMatric includes a Java based `HMIPServer`, that can be accessed through URLs starting with `/pages/jpages`. The `FirmwareController` class does however not perform any session id checks, thus this feature can be accessed without a valid session. Due to this issue, attackers can gain remote code execution as root user, allowing a full system compromise. Version 3.75.6.20240316 contains a patch."

A vulnerability in SecureProps version 1.2.0 and 1.2.1 involves a regex failing to detect tags during decryption of encrypted data. This occurs when the encrypted data has been encoded with `NullEncoder` and passed to `TagAwareCipher`, and contains special characters such as `\\n`. As a result, the decryption process is skipped since the tags are not detected. This causes the encrypted data to be returned in plain format.  The vulnerability affects users who implement `TagAwareCipher` with any base cipher that has `NullEncoder` (not default). The patch for the issue has been released. Users are advised to update to version 1.2.2. As a workaround, one may use the default `Base64Encoder` with the base cipher decorated with `TagAwareCipher` to prevent special characters in the encrypted string from interfering with regex tag detection logic.  This workaround is safe but may involve double encoding since `TagAwareCipher` uses `NullEncoder` by default."
