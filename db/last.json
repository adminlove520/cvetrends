However, Falcon has following behaviors while disobey the corresponding RFCs: accepting Content-Length header values that have `+` prefix, accepting Content-Length header values that written in hexadecimal with `0x` prefix, accepting `0x` and `+` prefixed chunk size, and accepting LF in chunk extension. This behavior can lead to desync when forwarding through multiple HTTP parsers, potentially results in HTTP request smuggling and firewall bypassing. This issue is fixed in `protocol-http1` v0.15.1.

According to the documentation, controllers are allowed to register new domains and extend the expiry of existing domains, but they cannot change the ownership or reduce the expiration time of existing domains. However, a preliminary analysis suggests that an attacker-controlled controller may be able to reduce the expiration time of existing domains due to an integer overflow in the renew function. The vulnerability resides `@ensdomains/ens-contracts` prior to version 0.0.22.\n\nIf successfully exploited, this vulnerability would enable attackers to force the expiration of any ENS record, ultimately allowing them to claim the affected domains for themselves. Currently, it would require a malicious DAO to exploit it. Nevertheless, any vulnerability present in the controllers could potentially render this issue exploitable in the future. An additional concern is the possibility of renewal discounts. Should ENS decide to implement a system that offers unlimited .eth domains for a fixed fee in the future, the vulnerability could become exploitable by any user due to the reduced attack cost.\n\nVersion 0.0.22 contains a patch for this issue. As long as registration cost remains linear or superlinear based on registration duration, or limited to a reasonable maximum (eg, 1 million years), this vulnerability could only be exploited by a malicious DAO. The interim workaround is thus to take no action.\n"

The mod used Java's `ObjectInputStream#readObject` on untrusted data coming from clients or servers over the network resulting in possible remote code execution when sending specifically crafted network packets after connecting. The affected versions were released between 2013 and 2016 and the issue (back then unknown) was fixed in 2016 by a refactoring of the network IO code.  \nThe issue is present in all Logistics Pipes versions ranged from 0.7.0.91 prior to 0.10.0.71, which were downloaded from different platforms summing up to multi-million downloads. For Minecraft version 1.7.10 the issue was fixed in build 0.10.0.71. Everybody on Minecraft 1.7.10 should check their version number of Logistics Pipes in their modlist and update, if the version number is smaller than 0.10.0.71. Any newer supported Minecraft version (like 1.12.2) never had a Logistics Pipes version with vulnerable code. The best available workaround for vulnerable versions is to play in singleplayer only or update to newer Minecraft versions and modpacks."

The library does not check that the servername part of the `sub` parameter (containing the user's *claimed* MXID) is the the same as the servername we are talking to. A malicious actor could spin up a server on any given domain, respond with a `sub` parameter according to the user they want to act as and use the resulting token to perform provisioning requests.
