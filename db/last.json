If exploited, it could allow unauthorized access to resources intended only for localhost. Setting `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1` in a request from a foreign host, will result in true for `ctx.IsFromLocal`. Access is limited to the scope of the affected process.

Before returning to\nthe caller all the XMM registers are set to zero rather than restoring their\nprevious content. The vulnerable code is used only on newer x86_64 processors\nsupporting the AVX512-IFMA instructions.\n\nThe consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption can\nbe various - from no consequences, if the calling application does not\ndepend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst\nconsequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the application\nprocess. However given the contents of the registers are just zeroized so\nthe attacker cannot put arbitrary values inside, the most likely consequence,\nif any, would be an incorrect result of some application dependent\ncalculations or a crash leading to a denial of service.\n\nThe POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of the\nCHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data)\nalgorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocol\nversions 1.2 and 1.3 and a malicious client can influence whether this AEAD\ncipher is used by the server. This implies that server applications using\nOpenSSL can be potentially impacted. However we are currently not aware of\nany concrete application that would be affected by this issue therefore we\nconsider this a Low severity security issue.\n\nAs a workaround the AVX512-IFMA instructions support can be disabled at\nruntime by setting the environment variable OPENSSL_ia32cap:\n\n   OPENSSL_ia32cap=:~0x200000\n\nThe FIPS provider is not affected by this issue."

An authenticated SQL injection vulnerability was discovered which allows authenticated users to perform privilege escalation and remote code execution.

This creates an SQL injection vulnerability. This issue has been addressed in version 1.2.25. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."

The default behaviour of `hyper-bump-it` is to display the planned changes and prompt the user for confirmation before editing any files. However, the configuration file provides a field that can be used cause files to be edited without displaying the prompt. This issue has been fixed in release version 0.5.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users that are unable to update from vulnerable versions, executing `hyper-bump-it` with the `--interactive` command line argument will ensure that all planned changes are displayed and prompt the user for confirmation before editing any files, even if the configuration file contains `show_confirm_prompt=true`.\n"

The vulnerability has been fixed by refactoring the internal query pipeline for a more concise code structure and implementing a patch to ensure the `beforeFind` trigger is invoked. This fix was introduced in commit `be4c7e23c6` and has been included in releases 6.2.2 and 5.5.5. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should make use of parse server's security layers to manage access levels with Class-Level Permissions and Object-Level Access Control that should be used instead of custom security layers in Cloud Code triggers."
