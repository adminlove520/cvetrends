In versions prior to 119.10, an attacker can attach an image in a html mail which is loaded from external resource in the default setting, which should prevent loading of external resources. When displaying emails containing external content, they should be loaded by default only after confirmation by the user. However, it could be recognized that certain embedded images (see PoC) are loaded, even though the \"Automatic Reloading of Images\" function is disabled by default. The reloading is also done unencrypted via HTTP and redirections are followed. This behavior is unexpected for the user, since the user assumes that external content will only be loaded after explicit manual confirmation. The loading of external content in e-mails represents a risk, because this makes the sender aware that the e-mail address is used, when the e-mail was read, which device is used and expose the user's IP address. Version 119.10 contains a patch for this issue."

        "summary": "Issue summary: A bug has been identified in the processing of key and\ninitialisation vector (IV) lengths.  This can lead to potential truncation\nor overruns during the initialisation of some symmetric ciphers.\n\nImpact summary: A truncation in the IV can result in non-uniqueness,\nwhich could result in loss of confidentiality for some cipher modes.\n\nWhen calling EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() or\nEVP_CipherInit_ex2() the provided OSSL_PARAM array is processed after\nthe key and IV have been established.  Any alterations to the key length,\nvia the \"keylen\" parameter or the IV length, via the \"ivlen\" parameter,\nwithin the OSSL_PARAM array will not take effect as intended, potentially\ncausing truncation or overreading of these values.  The following ciphers\nand cipher modes are impacted: RC2, RC4, RC5, CCM, GCM and OCB.\n\nFor the CCM, GCM and OCB cipher modes, truncation of the IV can result in\nloss of confidentiality.  For example, when following NIST's SP 800-38D\nsection 8.2.1 guidance for constructing a deterministic IV for AES in\nGCM mode, truncation of the counter portion could lead to IV reuse.\n\nBoth truncations and overruns of the key and overruns of the IV will\nproduce incorrect results and could, in some cases, trigger a memory\nexception.  However, these issues are not currently assessed as security\ncritical.\n\nChanging the key and/or IV lengths is not considered to be a common operation\nand the vulnerable API was recently introduced. Furthermore it is likely that\napplication developers will have spotted this problem during testing since\ndecryption would fail unless both peers in the communication were similarly\nvulnerable. For these reasons we expect the probability of an application being\nvulnerable to this to be quite low. However if an application is vulnerable then\nthis issue is considered very serious. For these reasons we have assessed this\nissue as Moderate severity overall.\n\nThe OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.\n\nThe OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this because\nthe issue lies outside of the FIPS provider boundary.\n\nOpenSSL 3.1 and 3.0 are vulnerable to this issue."

On 2023-01-01 during an internal audit of Grafana, a member of the security team found a stored XSS vulnerability affecting the core plugin \"Text\". The stored XSS vulnerability requires several user interactions in order to be fully exploited. The vulnerability was possible due to React's render cycle that will pass though the unsanitized HTML code, but in the next cycle the HTML is cleaned up and saved in Grafana's database. An attacker needs to have the Editor role in order to change a Text panel to include JavaScript. Another user needs to edit the same Text panel, and click on \"Markdown\" or \"HTML\" for the code to be executed. This means that vertical privilege escalation is possible, where a user with Editor role can change to a known password for a user having Admin role if the user with Admin role executes malicious JavaScript viewing a dashboard. This issue has been patched in versions 9.2.10 and 9.3.4."

        "summary": "Label Studio is an a popular open source data labeling tool. Versions prior to 1.9.2 have a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that could be exploited when an authenticated user uploads a crafted image file for their avatar that gets rendered as a HTML file on the website. Executing arbitrary JavaScript could result in an attacker performing malicious actions on Label Studio users if they visit the crafted avatar image. For an example, an attacker can craft a JavaScript payload that adds a new Django Super Administrator user if a Django administrator visits the image.\n\nThe file `users/functions.py` lines 18-49 show that the only verification check is that the file is an image by extracting the dimensions from the file. Label Studio serves avatar images using Django's built-in `serve` view, which is not secure for production use according to Django's documentation. The issue with the Django `serve` view is that it determines the `Content-Type` of the response by the file extension in the URL path. Therefore, an attacker can upload an image that contains malicious HTML code and name the file with a `.html` extension to be rendered as a HTML page. The only file extension validation is performed on the client-side, which can be easily bypassed.\n\nVersion 1.9.2 fixes this issue. Other remediation strategies include validating the file extension on the server side, not in client-side code; removing the use of Django's `serve` view and implement a secure controller for viewing uploaded avatar images; saving file content in the database rather than on the filesystem to mitigate against other file related vulnerabilities; and avoiding trusting user controlled inputs."

Prior to version 1.10.1, this feature could had been abused to download a HTML file that executed malicious JavaScript code in the context of the Label Studio website. Executing arbitrary JavaScript could result in an attacker performing malicious actions on Label Studio users if they visit the crafted avatar image. For an example, an attacker can craft a JavaScript payload that adds a new Django Super Administrator user if a Django administrator visits the image.\n\n`data_import/uploader.py` lines 125C5 through 146 showed that if a URL passed the server side request forgery verification checks, the contents of the file would be downloaded using the filename in the URL. The downloaded file path could then be retrieved by sending a request to `/api/projects/{project_id}/file-uploads?ids=[{download_id}]` where `{project_id}` was the ID of the project and `{download_id}` was the ID of the downloaded file. Once the downloaded file path was retrieved by the previous API endpoint, `data_import/api.py`lines 595C1 through 616C62 demonstrated that the `Content-Type` of the response was determined by the file extension, since `mimetypes.guess_type` guesses the `Content-Type` based on the file extension. Since the `Content-Type` was determined by the file extension of the downloaded file, an attacker could import in a `.html` file that would execute JavaScript when visited.\n\nVersion 1.10.1 contains a patch for this issue. Other remediation strategies are also available. For all user provided files that are downloaded by Label Studio, set the `Content-Security-Policy: sandbox;` response header when viewed on the site. The `sandbox` directive restricts a page's actions to prevent popups, execution of plugins and scripts and enforces a `same-origin` policy. Alternatively, restrict the allowed file extensions that may be downloaded."

        "summary": "Jetty is a java based web server and servlet engine. Nonstandard cookie parsing in Jetty may allow an attacker to smuggle cookies within other cookies, or otherwise perform unintended behavior by tampering with the cookie parsing mechanism. If Jetty sees a cookie VALUE that starts with `\"` (double quote), it will continue to read the cookie string until it sees a closing quote -- even if a semicolon is encountered. So, a cookie header such as: `DISPLAY_LANGUAGE=\"b; JSESSIONID=1337; c=d\"` will be parsed as one cookie, with the name DISPLAY_LANGUAGE and a value of b; JSESSIONID=1337; c=d instead of 3 separate cookies. This has security implications because if, say, JSESSIONID is an HttpOnly cookie, and the DISPLAY_LANGUAGE cookie value is rendered on the page, an attacker can smuggle the JSESSIONID cookie into the DISPLAY_LANGUAGE cookie and thereby exfiltrate it. This is significant when an intermediary is enacting some policy based on cookies, so a smuggled cookie can bypass that policy yet still be seen by the Jetty server or its logging system. This issue has been addressed in versions 9.4.51, 10.0.14, 11.0.14, and 12.0.0.beta0 and users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue."
