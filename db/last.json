In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be able to place a valid Gift Card product into the shopping cart. An uploaded file is placed at a predetermined path on the web server with a user-specified filename and extension. This occurs because the ywgc-upload-picture parameter can have a .php value even though the intention was to only allow uploads of Gift Card images."
