A Path Traversal vulnerability was found in the current version of Roxy-WI (6.3.9.0 at the moment of writing this report). The vulnerability can be exploited via an HTTP request to /app/options.py and the config_file_name parameter. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker with user level privileges to obtain the content of arbitrary files on the file server within the scope of what the server process has access to. The root-cause of the vulnerability lies in the get_config function of the /app/modules/config/config.py file, which only checks for relative path traversal, but still allows to read files from absolute locations passed via the config_file_name parameter."

The Livetable Macro wasn't properly sanitizing column names, thus allowing the insertion of raw HTML code including JavaScript. This vulnerability was also exploitable via the Documents Macro that is included since XWiki 3.5M1 and doesn't require script rights, this can be demonstrated with the syntax `{{documents id=\"example\" count=\"5\" actions=\"false\" columns=\"doc.title, before<script>alert(1)</script>after\"/}}`. Therefore, this can also be exploited by users without script right and in comments. With the interaction of a user with more rights, this could be used to execute arbitrary actions in the wiki, including privilege escalation, remote code execution, information disclosure, modifying or deleting content. This has been patched in XWiki 14.9, 14.4.6, and 13.10.10.\n"

It seems that the GET parameters passed in this request (to test if SMB credentials and hostname sent to the device work properly) result in being passed as commands to a \"system\" API in the function and thus result in command injection on the device. If the firmware version is dissected using binwalk tool, we obtain a cramfs-root archive which contains the filesystem set up on the device that contains all the binaries. The binary \"cgibox\" is the one that has the vulnerable function \"sub_7EAFC\" that receives the values sent by the GET request. If we open this binary in IDA-pro we will notice that this follows a ARM little endian format. The function sub_7EAFC in IDA pro is identified to be receiving the values sent in the GET request and the value set in GET parameter \"user\" is extracted in function sub_7E49C which is then passed to the vulnerable system API call."
