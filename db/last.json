        "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\naudit: improve robustness of the audit queue handling\n\nIf the audit daemon were ever to get stuck in a stopped state the\nkernel's kauditd_thread() could get blocked attempting to send audit\nrecords to the userspace audit daemon.  With the kernel thread\nblocked it is possible that the audit queue could grow unbounded as\ncertain audit record generating events must be exempt from the queue\nlimits else the system enter a deadlock state.\n\nThis patch resolves this problem by lowering the kernel thread's\nsocket sending timeout from MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT to HZ/10 and tweaks\nthe kauditd_send_queue() function to better manage the various audit\nqueues when connection problems occur between the kernel and the\naudit daemon.  With this patch, the backlog may temporarily grow\nbeyond the defined limits when the audit daemon is stopped and the\nsystem is under heavy audit pressure, but kauditd_thread() will\ncontinue to make progress and drain the queues as it would for other\nconnection problems.  For example, with the audit daemon put into a\nstopped state and the system configured to audit every syscall it\nwas still possible to shutdown the system without a kernel panic,\ndeadlock, etc.; granted, the system was slow to shutdown but that is\nto be expected given the extreme pressure of recording every syscall.\n\nThe timeout value of HZ/10 was chosen primarily through\nexperimentation and this developer's \"gut feeling\".  There is likely\nno one perfect value, but as this scenario is limited in scope (root\nprivileges would be needed to send SIGSTOP to the audit daemon), it\nis likely not worth exposing this as a tunable at present.  This can\nalways be done at a later date if it proves necessary."

This could allows attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data when the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with either a Context Lookup (for example, $${ctx:loginId}) or a Thread Context Map pattern (%X, %mdc, or %MDC) to craft malicious input data using a JNDI Lookup pattern resulting in an information leak and remote code execution in some environments and local code execution in all environments. Log4j 2.16.0 (Java 8) and 2.12.2 (Java 7) fix this issue by removing support for message lookup patterns and disabling JNDI functionality by default."

        "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: dsa: improve shutdown sequence\n\nAlexander Sverdlin presents 2 problems during shutdown with the\nlan9303 driver. One is specific to lan9303 and the other just happens\nto reproduce there.\n\nThe first problem is that lan9303 is unique among DSA drivers in that it\ncalls dev_get_drvdata() at \"arbitrary runtime\" (not probe, not shutdown,\nnot remove):\n\nphy_state_machine()\n-> ...\n   -> dsa_user_phy_read()\n      -> ds->ops->phy_read()\n         -> lan9303_phy_read()\n            -> chip->ops->phy_read()\n               -> lan9303_mdio_phy_read()\n                  -> dev_get_drvdata()\n\nBut we never stop the phy_state_machine(), so it may continue to run\nafter dsa_switch_shutdown(). Our common pattern in all DSA drivers is\nto set drvdata to NULL to suppress the remove() method that may come\nafterwards. But in this case it will result in an NPD.\n\nThe second problem is that the way in which we set\ndp->conduit->dsa_ptr = NULL; is concurrent with receive packet\nprocessing. dsa_switch_rcv() checks once whether dev->dsa_ptr is NULL,\nbut afterwards, rather than continuing to use that non-NULL value,\ndev->dsa_ptr is dereferenced again and again without NULL checks:\ndsa_conduit_find_user() and many other places. In between dereferences,\nthere is no locking to ensure that what was valid once continues to be\nvalid.\n\nBoth problems have the common aspect that closing the conduit interface\nsolves them.\n\nIn the first case, dev_close(conduit) triggers the NETDEV_GOING_DOWN\nevent in dsa_user_netdevice_event() which closes user ports as well.\ndsa_port_disable_rt() calls phylink_stop(), which synchronously stops\nthe phylink state machine, and ds->ops->phy_read() will thus no longer\ncall into the driver after this point.\n\nIn the second case, dev_close(conduit) should do this, as per\nDocumentation/networking/driver.rst:\n\n| Quiescence\n| ----------\n|\n| After the ndo_stop routine has been called, the hardware must\n| not receive or transmit any data.  All in flight packets must\n| be aborted. If necessary, poll or wait for completion of\n| any reset commands.\n\nSo it should be sufficient to ensure that later, when we zeroize\nconduit->dsa_ptr, there will be no concurrent dsa_switch_rcv() call\non this conduit.\n\nThe addition of the netif_device_detach() function is to ensure that\nioctls, rtnetlinks and ethtool requests on the user ports no longer\npropagate down to the driver - we're no longer prepared to handle them.\n\nThe race condition actually did not exist when commit 0650bf52b31f\n(\"net: dsa: be compatible with masters which unregister on shutdown\")\nfirst introduced dsa_switch_shutdown(). It was created later, when we\nstopped unregistering the user interfaces from a bad spot, and we just\nreplaced that sequence with a racy zeroization of conduit->dsa_ptr\n(one which doesn't ensure that the interfaces aren't up)."

This could fail, e.g. under memory pressure, when the IOMMU\ndriver just can't allocate more memory for page tables. While the code\ntries to handle this in the path below the err_unmap label it erroneously\nunmaps one entry from the sq's FIFO list of active mappings. Since the\ncurrent map attempt failed this unmap is removing some random DMA mapping\nthat might still be required. If the PCI function now presents that IOVA,\nthe IOMMU may assumes a rogue DMA access and e.g. on s390 puts the PCI\nfunction in error state.\n\nThe erroneous behavior was seen in a stress-test environment that created\nmemory pressure."

        "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nstatic_call: Handle module init failure correctly in static_call_del_module()\n\nModule insertion invokes static_call_add_module() to initialize the static\ncalls in a module. static_call_add_module() invokes __static_call_init(),\nwhich allocates a struct static_call_mod to either encapsulate the built-in\nstatic call sites of the associated key into it so further modules can be\nadded or to append the module to the module chain.\n\nIf that allocation fails the function returns with an error code and the\nmodule core invokes static_call_del_module() to clean up eventually added\nstatic_call_mod entries.\n\nThis works correctly, when all keys used by the module were converted over\nto a module chain before the failure. If not then static_call_del_module()\ncauses a #GP as it blindly assumes that key::mods points to a valid struct\nstatic_call_mod.\n\nThe problem is that key::mods is not a individual struct member of struct\nstatic_call_key, it's part of a union to save space:\n\n        union {\n                /* bit 0: 0 = mods, 1 = sites */\n                unsigned long type;\n                struct static_call_mod *mods;\n                struct static_call_site *sites;\n\t};\n\nkey::sites is a pointer to the list of built-in usage sites of the static\ncall. The type of the pointer is differentiated by bit 0. A mods pointer\nhas the bit clear, the sites pointer has the bit set.\n\nAs static_call_del_module() blidly assumes that the pointer is a valid\nstatic_call_mod type, it fails to check for this failure case and\ndereferences the pointer to the list of built-in call sites, which is\nobviously bogus.\n\nCure it by checking whether the key has a sites or a mods pointer.\n\nIf it's a sites pointer then the key is not to be touched. As the sites are\nwalked in the same order as in __static_call_init() the site walk can be\nterminated because all subsequent sites have not been touched by the init\ncode due to the error exit.\n\nIf it was converted before the allocation fail, then the inner loop which\nsearches for a module match will find nothing.\n\nA fail in the second allocation in __static_call_init() is harmless and\ndoes not require special treatment. The first allocation succeeded and\nconverted the key to a module chain. That first entry has mod::mod == NULL\nand mod::next == NULL, so the inner loop of static_call_del_module() will\nneither find a module match nor a module chain. The next site in the walk\nwas either already converted, but can't match the module, or it will exit\nthe outer loop because it has a static_call_site pointer and not a\nstatic_call_mod pointer."
