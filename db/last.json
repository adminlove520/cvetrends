Analyzing the core\ndump with drgn, I found that the waiter had already woken up and moved\non to a completely unrelated code path, clobbering what was previously\ndata->task. Meanwhile, the waker was passing the clobbered garbage in\ndata->task to wake_up_process(), leading to the crash.\n\nWhat's happening is that in between rq_qos_wake_function() deleting the\nwaitqueue entry and calling wake_up_process(), rq_qos_wait() is finding\nthat it already got a token and returning. The race looks like this:\n\nrq_qos_wait()                           rq_qos_wake_function()\n==============================================================\nprepare_to_wait_exclusive()\n                                        data->got_token = true;\n                                        list_del_init(&curr->entry);\nif (data.got_token)\n        break;\nfinish_wait(&rqw->wait, &data.wq);\n  ^- returns immediately because\n     list_empty_careful(&wq_entry->entry)\n     is true\n... return, go do something else ...\n                                        wake_up_process(data->task)\n                                          (NO LONGER VALID!)-^\n\nNormally, finish_wait() is supposed to synchronize against the waker.\nBut, as noted above, it is returning immediately because the waitqueue\nentry has already been removed from the waitqueue.\n\nThe bug is that rq_qos_wake_function() is accessing the waitqueue entry\nAFTER deleting it. Note that autoremove_wake_function() wakes the waiter\nand THEN deletes the waitqueue entry, which is the proper order.\n\nFix it by swapping the order. We also need to use\nlist_del_init_careful() to match the list_empty_careful() in\nfinish_wait()."
