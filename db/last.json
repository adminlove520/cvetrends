When a BGP update message is received over an established BGP session, and that message contains a specific, optional transitive attribute, this session will be torn down with an update message error. This issue cannot propagate beyond an affected system as the processing error occurs as soon as the update is received. This issue is exploitable remotely as the respective attribute can propagate through unaffected systems and intermediate AS (if any). Continuous receipt of a BGP update containing this attribute will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. Some customers have experienced these BGP session flaps which prompted Juniper SIRT to release this advisory out of cycle before fixed releases are widely available as there is an effective workaround. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS 15.1R1 and later versions prior to 20.4R3-S8; 21.1 version 21.1R1 and later versions prior to 21.2R3-S6; 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-S5; 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R3-S4; 22.1 versions prior to 22.1R3-S4; 22.2 versions prior to 22.2R3-S2; 22.3 versions prior to 22.2R3-S2; 22.4 versions prior to 22.4R2-S1, 22.4R3; 23.1 versions prior to 23.1R1-S1, 23.1R2.

Affected versions of the link plugin and link UI component do not sanitize URLs to prevent use of the `javascript:` scheme. As a result, links with JavaScript URLs can be inserted into the Plate editor through various means, including opening or pasting malicious content. `@udecode/plate-link` 20.0.0 resolves this issue by introducing an `allowedSchemes` option to the link plugin, defaulting to `['http', 'https', 'mailto', 'tel']`. URLs using a scheme that isn't in this list will not be rendered to the DOM. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade are advised to override the `LinkElement` and `PlateFloatingLink` components with implementations that explicitly check the URL scheme before rendering any anchor elements."

Nokia Single RAN commissioning procedures do not change (factory-time installed) default SSH public/private key values that are specific to a network operator. As a result, the CSP internal BTS network SSH server (disabled by default) continues to apply the default SSH public/private key values. These keys don't give access to BTS, because service user authentication is username/password-based on top of SSH. Nokia factory installed default SSH keys are meant to be changed from operator-specific values during the BTS deployment commissioning phase. However, before the 21B release, BTS commissioning manuals did not provide instructions to change default SSH keys (to BTS operator-specific values). This leads to a possibility for malicious operations staff (inside a CSP network) to attempt MITM exploitation of BTS service user access, during the moments that SSH is enabled for Nokia service personnel to perform troubleshooting activities."
