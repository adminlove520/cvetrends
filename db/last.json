ZooKeeper server doesn't do ACL check when the persistent watcher is triggered and as a consequence, the full path of znodes that a watch event gets triggered upon is exposed to the owner of the watcher. It's important to note that only the path is exposed by this vulnerability, not the data of znode, but since znode path can contain sensitive information like user name or login ID, this issue is potentially critical.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 3.9.2, 3.8.4 which fixes the issue.\n"

        "summary": "The LA-Studio Element Kit for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the LinkWrapper attribute found in several widgets in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.7.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping the user supplied attribute. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."
