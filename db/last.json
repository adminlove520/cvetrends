This occurs because the mt19937 Mersenne Twister takes a single 32-bit value as an input seed, resulting in only four billion possible mnemonics. The affected versions of the browser extension are 0.0.172 through 0.0.182. To steal funds efficiently, an attacker can identify all Ethereum addresses created since the 0.0.172 release, and check whether they are Ethereum addresses that could have been created by this extension. To respond to the risk, affected users need to upgrade the product version and also move funds to a new wallet address."

In versions 0.4.0 and 0.5.0, if an attacker is able allocate arbitrary many bytes in the Bitswap server, those allocations are lasting even if the connection is closed. This affects users accepting untrusted connections with the Bitswap server and also affects users using the old API stubs at `github.com/ipfs/go-libipfs/bitswap` because users then transitively import `github.com/ipfs/go-libipfs/bitswap/server`. Boxo versions 0.6.0 and 0.4.1 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, those who are using the stub object at `github.com/ipfs/go-libipfs/bitswap` not taking advantage of the features provided by the server can refactor their code to use the new split API that will allow them to run in a client only mode: `github.com/ipfs/go-libipfs/bitswap/client`."
