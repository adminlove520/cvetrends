It turns out dropping\n\t   USERGS_SYSRET64 simplifies the code, allowing CLEAR_CPU_BUFFERS\n\t   to be explicitly added to syscall_return_via_sysret path. Below\n\t   is with CONFIG_PARAVIRT_XXL=y and this patch applied:\n\n\t   syscall_return_via_sysret:\n\t   ...\n\t   <+342>:   swapgs\n\t   <+345>:   xchg   %ax,%ax\n\t   <+347>:   verw   -0x1a2(%rip)  <------\n\t   <+354>:   sysretq\n  ]"

A bug in Wagtail's `parse_query_string` would result in it taking a long time to process suitably crafted inputs. When used to parse sufficiently long strings of characters without a space, `parse_query_string` would take an unexpectedly large amount of time to process, resulting in a denial of service. In an initial Wagtail installation, the vulnerability can be exploited by any Wagtail admin user. It cannot be exploited by end users. If your Wagtail site has a custom search implementation which uses `parse_query_string`, it may be exploitable by other users (e.g. unauthenticated users).
