Any Dispatch users who own their instance and rely on the `Dispatch Plugin - Basic Authentication Provider` plugin for authentication may be impacted, allowing for any account to be taken over within their own instance. This could be done by using the secret to sign attacker crafted JWTs. If you think that you may be impacted, we strongly suggest you to rotate the secret stored in the `DISPATCH_JWT_SECRET` envvar in the `.env` file.

        "summary": "The Cisco Umbrella Virtual Appliance Version 2.0.3 and prior contained an undocumented encrypted remote support tunnel (SSH) which auto initiated from the customer's appliance to Cisco's SSH Hubs in the Umbrella datacenters. These tunnels were primarily leveraged for remote support and allowed for authorized/authenticated personnel from the Cisco Umbrella team to access the appliance remotely and obtain full control without explicit customer approval. To address this vulnerability, the Umbrella Virtual Appliance version 2.1.0 now requires explicit customer approval before an SSH tunnel from the VA to the Cisco terminating server can be established."

Users unable to upgrade may manually apply the patch on `Invitation.InvitationCommon` and `Invitation.InvitationConfig`, but there are otherwise no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
