The vulnerability arises from the application's handling of user modifications by managers or admins, allowing for the modification of all existing attributes of the `user` database entity without proper checks or sanitization. This flaw can be exploited to delete user threads, denying users access to their previously submitted data, or to inject fake threads and/or chat history for social engineering attacks."

For zoned btrfs, we re-dirty a freed tree\nnode to ensure btrfs can write the region and does not leave a hole on\nwrite on a zoned device. The current code fails to re-dirty a node\nwhen the tree-log tree's depth is greater or equal to 2. That leads to\na transaction abort with -EAGAIN.\n\nFix the issue by properly re-dirtying a node on walking up the tree."
