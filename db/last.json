Even though the CVE-2016-2183 has been fixed in the etcd components, to enable periodic health checks from kubelet, it was necessary to open up a new port (9979) on etcd grpc-proxy. Therefore, this port might still be considered vulnerable to the same type of attack. The health checks on etcd grpc-proxy do not contain sensitive data, only metrics data. The potential impact related to this vulnerability is minimal. The CVE-2023-0296 has been assigned to this issue to track the permanent fix in the etcd component."
