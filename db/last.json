Ruby-SAML in <= 12.2 and 1.13.0 <= 1.16.0 does not properly verify the signature of the SAML Response. An unauthenticated attacker with access to any signed saml document (by the IdP) can thus forge a SAML Response/Assertion with arbitrary contents. This would allow the attacker to log in as arbitrary user within the vulnerable system. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.17.0 and 1.12.3."

Although, those conditions do not include this scenario, when an unauthenticated request returns user credentials. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.13.3 and 11.1.0."

We are guaranteed\nto have at least one stable reference in slow path, so the simple atomic add\ncould be used.  The performance difference should be trivial, but the\nmisuse may be confusing and misleading.\n\nRedefined try_grab_folio() to try_grab_folio_fast(), and try_grab_page()\nto try_grab_folio(), and use them in the proper paths.
