The vulnerability is due to a memory management issue in the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a large number of VPLS-generated MAC entries in the MAC address table of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a C6800-16P10G or C6800-16P10G-XL type line card to crash, resulting in a DoS condition. This vulnerability affects Cisco Catalyst 6800 Series Switches that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS Software and have a Cisco C6800-16P10G or C6800-16P10G-XL line card in use with Supervisor Engine 6T. To be vulnerable, the device must also be configured with VPLS and the C6800-16P10G or C6800-16P10G-XL line card needs to be the core-facing MPLS interfaces. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCva61927."

Versions before 0.7.0 of vodozemac use a non-constant time base64 implementation for importing key material for Megolm group sessions and `PkDecryption` Ed25519 secret keys. This flaw might allow an attacker to infer some information about the secret key material through a side-channel attack. The use of a non-constant time base64 implementation might allow an attacker to observe timing variations in the encoding and decoding operations of the secret key material. This could potentially provide insights into the underlying secret key material. The impact of this vulnerability is considered low because exploiting the attacker is required to have access to high precision timing measurements, as well as repeated access to the base64 encoding or decoding processes.  Additionally, the estimated leakage amount is bounded and low according to the referenced paper. This has been patched in commit 734b6c6948d4b2bdee3dd8b4efa591d93a61d272 which has been included in release version 0.7.0. Users are advised to upgrade.

        "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Fix too early release of tcx_entry\n\nPedro Pinto and later independently also Hyunwoo Kim and Wongi Lee reported\nan issue that the tcx_entry can be released too early leading to a use\nafter free (UAF) when an active old-style ingress or clsact qdisc with a\nshared tc block is later replaced by another ingress or clsact instance.\n\nEssentially, the sequence to trigger the UAF (one example) can be as follows:\n\n  1. A network namespace is created\n  2. An ingress qdisc is created. This allocates a tcx_entry, and\n     &tcx_entry->miniq is stored in the qdisc's miniqp->p_miniq. At the\n     same time, a tcf block with index 1 is created.\n  3. chain0 is attached to the tcf block. chain0 must be connected to\n     the block linked to the ingress qdisc to later reach the function\n     tcf_chain0_head_change_cb_del() which triggers the UAF.\n  4. Create and graft a clsact qdisc. This causes the ingress qdisc\n     created in step 1 to be removed, thus freeing the previously linked\n     tcx_entry:\n\n     rtnetlink_rcv_msg()\n       => tc_modify_qdisc()\n         => qdisc_create()\n           => clsact_init() [a]\n         => qdisc_graft()\n           => qdisc_destroy()\n             => __qdisc_destroy()\n               => ingress_destroy() [b]\n                 => tcx_entry_free()\n                   => kfree_rcu() // tcx_entry freed\n\n  5. Finally, the network namespace is closed. This registers the\n     cleanup_net worker, and during the process of releasing the\n     remaining clsact qdisc, it accesses the tcx_entry that was\n     already freed in step 4, causing the UAF to occur:\n\n     cleanup_net()\n       => ops_exit_list()\n         => default_device_exit_batch()\n           => unregister_netdevice_many()\n             => unregister_netdevice_many_notify()\n               => dev_shutdown()\n                 => qdisc_put()\n                   => clsact_destroy() [c]\n                     => tcf_block_put_ext()\n                       => tcf_chain0_head_change_cb_del()\n                         => tcf_chain_head_change_item()\n                           => clsact_chain_head_change()\n                             => mini_qdisc_pair_swap() // UAF\n\nThere are also other variants, the gist is to add an ingress (or clsact)\nqdisc with a specific shared block, then to replace that qdisc, waiting\nfor the tcx_entry kfree_rcu() to be executed and subsequently accessing\nthe current active qdisc's miniq one way or another.\n\nThe correct fix is to turn the miniq_active boolean into a counter. What\ncan be observed, at step 2 above, the counter transitions from 0->1, at\nstep [a] from 1->2 (in order for the miniq object to remain active during\nthe replacement), then in [b] from 2->1 and finally [c] 1->0 with the\neventual release. The reference counter in general ranges from [0,2] and\nit does not need to be atomic since all access to the counter is protected\nby the rtnl mutex. With this in place, there is no longer a UAF happening\nand the tcx_entry is freed at the correct time."

        "summary": "libuv is a multi-platform support library with a focus on asynchronous I/O. The `uv_getaddrinfo` function in `src/unix/getaddrinfo.c` (and its windows counterpart `src/win/getaddrinfo.c`), truncates hostnames to 256 characters before calling `getaddrinfo`. This behavior can be exploited to create addresses like `0x00007f000001`, which are considered valid by `getaddrinfo` and could allow an attacker to craft payloads that resolve to unintended IP addresses, bypassing developer checks. The vulnerability arises due to how the `hostname_ascii` variable (with a length of 256 bytes) is handled in `uv_getaddrinfo` and subsequently in `uv__idna_toascii`. When the hostname exceeds 256 characters, it gets truncated without a terminating null byte. As a result attackers may be able to access internal APIs or for websites (similar to MySpace) that allows users to have `username.example.com` pages. Internal services that crawl or cache these user pages can be exposed to SSRF attacks if a malicious user chooses a long vulnerable username. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.48.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
