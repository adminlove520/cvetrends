Log4cxx compiled with ODBC support(before version 1.1.0, this was auto-detected at compile time)\n\n2. ODBCAppender enabled for logging messages to, generally done via a config file\n\n3. User input is logged at some point. If your application does not have user input, it is unlikely to be affected.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 1.1.0 which properly binds the parameters to the SQL statement, or migrate to the new DBAppender class which supports an ODBC connection in addition to other databases. \nNote that this fix does require a configuration file update, as the old configuration files will not configure properly.\u00a0 An example is shown below, and more information may be found in the Log4cxx documentation on the ODBCAppender.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of old configuration snippet:\n\n<appender name=\"SqlODBCAppender\" class=\"ODBCAppender\">\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <param name=\"sql\" value=\"INSERT INTO logs (message) VALUES ('%m')\" />\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ... other params here ...\n\n</appender>\n\n\n\n\nThe migrated configuration snippet with new ColumnMapping parameters:\n\n\n<appender name=\"SqlODBCAppender\" class=\"ODBCAppender\">\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 <param name=\"sql\" value=\"INSERT INTO logs (message) VALUES (?)\" />\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <param name=\"ColumnMapping\" value=\"message\"/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ... other params here ...\n\n\n</appender>\n\n\n\n\n\n"
