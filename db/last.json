The group contains a list\nof ACLs. In turn, each ACL points to a different TCAM region where the\nfilters are stored. During forwarding, the ACLs are sequentially\nevaluated until a match is found.\n\nOne reason to place filters in different regions is when they are added\nwith decreasing priorities and in an alternating order so that two\nconsecutive filters can never fit in the same region because of their\nkey usage.\n\nIn Spectrum-2 and newer ASICs the firmware started to report that the\nmaximum number of ACLs in a group is more than 16, but the layout of the\nregister that configures ACL groups (PAGT) was not updated to account\nfor that. It is therefore possible to hit stack corruption [1] in the\nrare case where more than 16 ACLs in a group are required.\n\nFix by limiting the maximum ACL group size to the minimum between what\nthe firmware reports and the maximum ACLs that fit in the PAGT register.\n\nAdd a test case to make sure the machine does not crash when this\ncondition is hit.\n\n[1]\nKernel panic - not syncing: stack-protector: Kernel stack is corrupted in: mlxsw_sp_acl_tcam_group_update+0x116/0x120\n[...]\n dump_stack_lvl+0x36/0x50\n panic+0x305/0x330\n __stack_chk_fail+0x15/0x20\n mlxsw_sp_acl_tcam_group_update+0x116/0x120\n mlxsw_sp_acl_tcam_group_region_attach+0x69/0x110\n mlxsw_sp_acl_tcam_vchunk_get+0x492/0xa20\n mlxsw_sp_acl_tcam_ventry_add+0x25/0xe0\n mlxsw_sp_acl_rule_add+0x47/0x240\n mlxsw_sp_flower_replace+0x1a9/0x1d0\n tc_setup_cb_add+0xdc/0x1c0\n fl_hw_replace_filter+0x146/0x1f0\n fl_change+0xc17/0x1360\n tc_new_tfilter+0x472/0xb90\n rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x313/0x3b0\n netlink_rcv_skb+0x58/0x100\n netlink_unicast+0x244/0x390\n netlink_sendmsg+0x1e4/0x440\n ____sys_sendmsg+0x164/0x260\n ___sys_sendmsg+0x9a/0xe0\n __sys_sendmsg+0x7a/0xc0\n do_syscall_64+0x40/0xe0\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0x6b"

This can be exploited for remote code execution (RCE), for instance if the file written outside the working tree is a git filter that gets executed on a subsequent git command.\n\nThe issue occurs only on case-insensitive filesystems, like the default filesystems on Windows and macOS. The user performing the clone or checkout must have the rights to create symbolic links for the problem to occur, and symbolic links must be enabled in the git configuration.\n\nSetting git configuration option core.symlinks = false\u00a0before checking out avoids the problem.\n\nThe issue was fixed in Eclipse JGit version 6.6.1.202309021850-r and 6.7.0.202309050840-r, available via  Maven Central https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/eclipse/jgit/ \u00a0and  repo.eclipse.org https://repo.eclipse.org/content/repositories/jgit-releases/ . A backport is available in 5.13.3 starting from  5.13.3.202401111512-r.\n\n\nThe JGit maintainers would like to thank RyotaK for finding and reporting this issue.\n\n\n\n"

NOTE: some parties have mapped the recursive Reflection API issue to CVE-2012-3174, but CVE-2012-3174 is for a different vulnerability whose details are not public as of 20130114.  CVE-2013-0422 covers both the JMX/MBean and Reflection API issues.  NOTE: it was originally reported that Java 6 was also vulnerable, but the reporter has retracted this claim, stating that Java 6 is not exploitable because the relevant code is called in a way that does not bypass security checks.  NOTE: as of 20130114, a reliable third party has claimed that the findClass/MBeanInstantiator vector was not fixed in Oracle Java 7 Update 11.  If there is still a vulnerable condition, then a separate CVE identifier might be created for the unfixed issue."
