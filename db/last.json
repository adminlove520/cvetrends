When feeding untrusted user input into the size parameter of `NewBitfield` and `FromBytes` functions, an attacker can trigger `panic`s. This happen when the `size` is a not a multiple of `8` or is negative. There were already a note in the `NewBitfield` documentation, however known users of this package are subject to this issue. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that `size` is a multiple of 8 before calling `NewBitfield` or `FromBytes`."

When this time namespace is destroyed, the vvar page is also freed, but not removed from the process' memory, and a next page allocated by the kernel will be still available from the user-space process and can leak memory contents via this (read-only) use-after-free vulnerability.

When computing the relative path to locate the resource, in case of wildcards, the code: `return \"/\" + rest;` from `Utils.java` returns the user input (without validation) as the segment to lookup. Even though checks are performed to avoid escaping the sandbox, given that the input was not sanitized `\\` are not properly handled and an attacker can build a path that is valid within the classpath. This issue only affects users deploying in windows environments and upgrading is the advised remediation path. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
