The problem\narises from the following sequence.\n        1. In dwc3_gadget_suspend, there is a chance of a timeout when\n        moving the USB core to the halt state after clearing the\n        run/stop bit by software.\n        2. In dwc3_core_exit, the event buffer is cleared regardless of\n        the USB core's status, which may lead to an SMMU faults and\n        other memory issues. if the USB core tries to access the event\n        buffer address.\n\nTo prevent this hardware quirk on Exynos platforms, this commit ensures\nthat the event buffer address is not cleared by software  when the USB\ncore is active during runtime suspend by checking its status before\nclearing the buffer address."

Additionally, it increases the attack surface because at any given time, two OTPs are valid."

The issue manifests if we want to use another hypervisor (like\nXen or KVM), which does not know anything about those specific mappings.\n\nChanging the mapping of cmd-db memory from MEMREMAP_WB to MEMREMAP_WT/WC\nremoves dependency on correct mappings in Stage 2 tables.
