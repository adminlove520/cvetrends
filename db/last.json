After that\nwe call btrfs_commit_transaction(), and if that returns an error we jump\nto 'fail' label, where we kfree() the pending snapshot structure. This can\nresult in a later use-after-free of the pending snapshot:\n\n1) We allocated the pending snapshot and added it to the transaction's\n   list of pending snapshots;\n\n2) We call btrfs_commit_transaction(), and it fails either at the first\n   call to btrfs_run_delayed_refs() or btrfs_start_dirty_block_groups().\n   In both cases, we don't abort the transaction and we release our\n   transaction handle. We jump to the 'fail' label and free the pending\n   snapshot structure. We return with the pending snapshot still in the\n   transaction's list;\n\n3) Another task commits the transaction. This time there's no error at\n   all, and then during the transaction commit it accesses a pointer\n   to the pending snapshot structure that the snapshot creation task\n   has already freed, resulting in a user-after-free.\n\nThis issue could actually be detected by smatch, which produced the\nfollowing warning:\n\n  fs/btrfs/ioctl.c:843 create_snapshot() warn: '&pending_snapshot->list' not removed from list\n\nSo fix this by not having the snapshot creation ioctl directly add the\npending snapshot to the transaction's list. Instead add the pending\nsnapshot to the transaction handle, and then at btrfs_commit_transaction()\nwe add the snapshot to the list only when we can guarantee that any error\nreturned after that point will result in a transaction abort, in which\ncase the ioctl code can safely free the pending snapshot and no one can\naccess it anymore."

However, this wait can be infinite and results\nin deadlock because of circular dependency among the quota disable\nioctl, the qgroup rescan worker and the other task with transaction such\nas block group relocation task.\n\nThe deadlock happens with the steps following:\n\n1) Task A calls ioctl to disable quota. It starts a transaction and\n   waits for qgroup rescan worker completes.\n2) Task B such as block group relocation task starts a transaction and\n   joins to the transaction that task A started. Then task B commits to\n   the transaction. In this commit, task B waits for a commit by task A.\n3) Task C as the qgroup rescan worker starts its job and starts a\n   transaction. In this transaction start, task C waits for completion\n   of the transaction that task A started and task B committed.\n\nThis deadlock was found with fstests test case btrfs/115 and a zoned\nnull_blk device. The test case enables and disables quota, and the\nblock group reclaim was triggered during the quota disable by chance.\nThe deadlock was also observed by running quota enable and disable in\nparallel with 'btrfs balance' command on regular null_blk devices.\n\nAn example report of the deadlock:\n\n  [372.469894] INFO: task kworker/u16:6:103 blocked for more than 122 seconds.\n  [372.479944]       Not tainted 5.16.0-rc8 #7\n  [372.485067] \"echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/hung_task_timeout_secs\" disables this message.\n  [372.493898] task:kworker/u16:6   state:D stack:    0 pid:  103 ppid:     2 flags:0x00004000\n  [372.503285] Workqueue: btrfs-qgroup-rescan btrfs_work_helper [btrfs]\n  [372.510782] Call Trace:\n  [372.514092]  <TASK>\n  [372.521684]  __schedule+0xb56/0x4850\n  [372.530104]  ? io_schedule_timeout+0x190/0x190\n  [372.538842]  ? lockdep_hardirqs_on+0x7e/0x100\n  [372.547092]  ? _raw_spin_unlock_irqrestore+0x3e/0x60\n  [372.555591]  schedule+0xe0/0x270\n  [372.561894]  btrfs_commit_transaction+0x18bb/0x2610 [btrfs]\n  [372.570506]  ? btrfs_apply_pending_changes+0x50/0x50 [btrfs]\n  [372.578875]  ? free_unref_page+0x3f2/0x650\n  [372.585484]  ? finish_wait+0x270/0x270\n  [372.591594]  ? release_extent_buffer+0x224/0x420 [btrfs]\n  [372.599264]  btrfs_qgroup_rescan_worker+0xc13/0x10c0 [btrfs]\n  [372.607157]  ? lock_release+0x3a9/0x6d0\n  [372.613054]  ? btrfs_qgroup_account_extent+0xda0/0xda0 [btrfs]\n  [372.620960]  ? do_raw_spin_lock+0x11e/0x250\n  [372.627137]  ? rwlock_bug.part.0+0x90/0x90\n  [372.633215]  ? lock_is_held_type+0xe4/0x140\n  [372.639404]  btrfs_work_helper+0x1ae/0xa90 [btrfs]\n  [372.646268]  process_one_work+0x7e9/0x1320\n  [372.652321]  ? lock_release+0x6d0/0x6d0\n  [372.658081]  ? pwq_dec_nr_in_flight+0x230/0x230\n  [372.664513]  ? rwlock_bug.part.0+0x90/0x90\n  [372.670529]  worker_thread+0x59e/0xf90\n  [372.676172]  ? process_one_work+0x1320/0x1320\n  [372.682440]  kthread+0x3b9/0x490\n  [372.687550]  ? _raw_spin_unlock_irq+0x24/0x50\n  [372.693811]  ? set_kthread_struct+0x100/0x100\n  [372.700052]  ret_from_fork+0x22/0x30\n  [372.705517]  </TASK>\n  [372.709747] INFO: task btrfs-transacti:2347 blocked for more than 123 seconds.\n  [372.729827]       Not tainted 5.16.0-rc8 #7\n  [372.745907] \"echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/hung_task_timeout_secs\" disables this message.\n  [372.767106] task:btrfs-transacti state:D stack:    0 pid: 2347 ppid:     2 flags:0x00004000\n  [372.787776] Call Trace:\n  [372.801652]  <TASK>\n  [372.812961]  __schedule+0xb56/0x4850\n  [372.830011]  ? io_schedule_timeout+0x190/0x190\n  [372.852547]  ? lockdep_hardirqs_on+0x7e/0x100\n  [372.871761]  ? _raw_spin_unlock_irqrestore+0x3e/0x60\n  [372.886792]  schedule+0xe0/0x270\n  [372.901685]  wait_current_trans+0x22c/0x310 [btrfs]\n  [372.919743]  ? btrfs_put_transaction+0x3d0/0x3d0 [btrfs]\n  [372.938923]  ? finish_wait+0x270/0x270\n  [372.959085]  ? join_transaction+0xc7\n---truncated---"
