The mySQL JDBC driver in particular is known to be vulnerable to this class of attack. As a result an application using Apache Jena SDB can be subject to RCE when connected to a malicious database server. Apache Jena SDB has been EOL since December 2020 and users should migrate to alternative options e.g. Apache Jena TDB 2."
