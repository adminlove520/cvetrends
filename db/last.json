If a user submits a very long password when logging in, the system will be forced to execute the long password MD5 encryption process, causing the server CPU and memory to be exhausted, thereby causing a denial of service attack on the server.

        "summary": "Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Versions prior to 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 are vulnerable to a phishing attack vulnerability that involves a user uploading malicious files. A malicious user could upload an HTML file to Parse Server via its public API. That HTML file would then be accessible at the internet domain at which Parse Server is hosted. The URL of the the uploaded HTML could be shared for phishing attacks. The HTML page may seem legitimate because it is served under the internet domain where Parse Server is hosted, which may be the same as a company's official website domain.\n\nAn additional security issue arises when the Parse JavaScript SDK is used. The SDK stores sessions in the internet browser's local storage, which usually restricts data access depending on the internet domain. A malicious HTML file could contain a script that retrieves the user's session token from local storage and then share it with the attacker.\n\nThe fix included in versions 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 adds a new Parse Server option `fileUpload.fileExtensions` to restrict file upload on Parse Server by file extension. It is recommended to restrict file upload for HTML file extensions, which this fix disables by default. If an app requires upload of files with HTML file extensions, the option can be set to `['.*']` or another custom value to override the default."

Prior to version 0.16.0, a virtual machine instance with a malicious disk image could read a single file on the host filesystem, even when no filesystem is mounted from the host. The official templates of Lima and the well-known third party products (Colima, Rancher Desktop, and Finch) are unlikely to be affected by this issue. To exploit this issue, the attacker has to embed the target file path (an absolute or a relative path from the instance directory) in a malicious disk image, as the qcow2 (or vmdk) backing file path string. As Lima refuses to run as the root, it is practically impossible for the attacker to read the entire host disk via `/dev/rdiskN`. Also, practically, the attacker cannot read at least the first 512 bytes (MBR) of the target file. The issue has been patched in Lima in version 0.16.0 by prohibiting using a backing file path in the VM base image."

OBJ_obj2txt() may be used to translate\nan ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER given in DER encoding form (using the OpenSSL\ntype ASN1_OBJECT) to its canonical numeric text form, which are the\nsub-identifiers of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in decimal form, separated by\nperiods.\n\nWhen one of the sub-identifiers in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER is very large\n(these are sizes that are seen as absurdly large, taking up tens or hundreds\nof KiBs), the translation to a decimal number in text may take a very long\ntime.  The time complexity is O(n^2) with 'n' being the size of the\nsub-identifiers in bytes (*).\n\nWith OpenSSL 3.0, support to fetch cryptographic algorithms using names /\nidentifiers in string form was introduced.  This includes using OBJECT\nIDENTIFIERs in canonical numeric text form as identifiers for fetching\nalgorithms.\n\nSuch OBJECT IDENTIFIERs may be received through the ASN.1 structure\nAlgorithmIdentifier, which is commonly used in multiple protocols to specify\nwhat cryptographic algorithm should be used to sign or verify, encrypt or\ndecrypt, or digest passed data.\n\nApplications that call OBJ_obj2txt() directly with untrusted data are\naffected, with any version of OpenSSL.  If the use is for the mere purpose\nof display, the severity is considered low.\n\nIn OpenSSL 3.0 and newer, this affects the subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME,\nCMS, CMP/CRMF or TS.  It also impacts anything that processes X.509\ncertificates, including simple things like verifying its signature.\n\nThe impact on TLS is relatively low, because all versions of OpenSSL have a\n100KiB limit on the peer's certificate chain.  Additionally, this only\nimpacts clients, or servers that have explicitly enabled client\nauthentication.\n\nIn OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2, this only affects displaying diverse objects,\nsuch as X.509 certificates.  This is assumed to not happen in such a way\nthat it would cause a Denial of Service, so these versions are considered\nnot affected by this issue in such a way that it would be cause for concern,\nand the severity is therefore considered low."
