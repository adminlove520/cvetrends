Therefore it was possible for users of legacy, pre-2017 browsers who navigate to a page serving `fides.js` to download and execute malicious scripts from the `polyfill.io` domain when the domain was compromised and serving malware. No exploitation of `fides.js` via `polyfill.io` has been identified as of time of publication.\n\nThe vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.39.1`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat. On Thursday, June 27, 2024, Cloudflare and Namecheap intervened at a domain level to ensure `polyfill.io` and its subdomains could not resolve to the compromised service, rendering this vulnerability unexploitable. Prior to the domain level intervention, there were no server-side workarounds and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability impacts of this vulnerability were high. Clients could ensure they were not affected by using a modern browser that supported the fetch standard."

Prior to version 0.26.1, the Pomerium user info page (at `/.pomerium`) unintentionally included serialized OAuth2 access and ID tokens from the logged-in user's session. These tokens are not intended to be exposed to end users. This issue may be more severe in the presence of a cross-site scripting vulnerability in an upstream application proxied through Pomerium. If an attacker could insert a malicious script onto a web page proxied through Pomerium, that script could access these tokens by making a request to the `/.pomerium` endpoint. Upstream applications that authenticate only the ID token may be vulnerable to user impersonation using a token obtained in this manner. Note that an OAuth2 access token or ID token by itself is not sufficient to hijack a user's Pomerium session. Upstream applications should not be vulnerable to user impersonation via these tokens provided the application verifies the Pomerium JWT for each request, the connection between Pomerium and the application is secured by mTLS, or the connection between Pomerium and the application is otherwise secured at the network layer. The issue is patched in Pomerium v0.26.1. No known workarounds are available."

Prior to versions 31.2, 30.4, and 29.6, Remote Code Execution (RCE) is possible if an application uses certain GeoTools functionality to evaluate XPath expressions supplied by user input. Versions 31.2, 30.4, and 29.6 contain a fix for this issue. As a workaround, GeoTools can operate with reduced functionality by removing the `gt-complex` jar from one's application. As an example of the impact, application schema `datastore` would not function without the ability to use XPath expressions to query complex content. Alternatively, one may utilize a drop-in replacement GeoTools jar from SourceForge for versions 31.1, 30.3, 30.2, 29.2, 28.2, 27.5, 27.4, 26.7, 26.4, 25.2, and 24.0. These jars are for download only and are not available from maven central, intended to quickly provide a fix to affected applications."

Prior to version 2024.07.01, `yt-dlp` does not limit the extensions of downloaded files, which could lead to aribitrary filenames being created in the download folder (and path traversal on Windows). Since `yt-dlp` also reads config from the working directory (and on Windows executables will be executed from the yt-dlp directory) this could lead to arbitrary code being executed. `yt-dlp` version 2024.07.01 fixes this issue by whitelisting the allowed extensions. This might mean some very uncommon extensions might not get downloaded, however it will also limit the possible exploitation surface. In addition to upgrading, have `.%(ext)s` at the end of the output template and make sure the user trusts the websites that they are downloading from. Also, make sure to never download to a directory within PATH or other sensitive locations like one's user directory, `system32`, or other binaries locations. For users who are not able to upgrade, keep the default output template (`-o \"%(title)s [%(id)s].%(ext)s`); make sure the extension of the media to download is a common video/audio/sub/... one; try to avoid the generic extractor; and/or use `--ignore-config --config-location ...` to not load config from common locations."
