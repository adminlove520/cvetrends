With certain payloads, theft of the target user\u2019s long-lived session token is possible. Note that Zusam, at the time of writing, uses a user\u2019s static API key as a long-lived session token, and these terms can be used interchangeably on the platform. This session token/API key remains valid indefinitely, so long as the user doesn\u2019t expressly request a new one via their Settings page. Version 0.5.6 fixes the cross-site scripting vulnerability."
